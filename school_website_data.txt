A Strong Launch into Life
Pomona College is a close-knit and diverse community of accomplished scholars, scientists, entrepreneurs and artists who are passionate about making a difference in the world.
Intellectual Opportunity
Classes are small, so students and faculty can build close relationships, delve into research and explore across academic fields. More than half of all Pomona students work closely with professors in research projects, receiving academic and financial support for a deeper approach to learning.
WATCH: Faculty and Student Research
The Power of Place
More than 90% of our students live on campus here in Southern California all four years, and many professors live within five miles of campus. New collaborations or discussions can spring up anywhere – a residence hall, club meeting or at lunch with a professor.
Living at Pomona
Center for Global Engagement
Engaging with the wider world is central to the Pomona College experience. In the years ahead, a new Center for Global Engagement will rise at the heart of our campus.

Overview
YouTube has always had a set of Community Guidelines that outline what type of content isn’t allowed on YouTube. These policies apply to all types of content on our platform, including videos, comments, links, and thumbnails. Our Community Guidelines are a key part of ourbroader suite of policiesand are regularly updated in consultation with outside experts and YouTube creators to keep pace with emerging challenges.
We enforce these Community Guidelines using a combination of human reviewers and machine learning, and apply them to everyone equally—regardless of the subject or the creator’s background, political viewpoint, position, or affiliation.
Our policies aim to make YouTube a safer community while still giving creators the freedom to share a broad range of experiences and perspectives.
What areas do Community Guidelines cover?

How YouTube evaluates Educational, Documentary, Scientific, and Artistic (EDSA) content
In addition to Community Guidelines, creators who want to monetize content on YouTube must comply withMonetization Policies.
How does YouTube develop new policies and update existing ones?
Each of our policies is carefully thought through so they are consistent, well-informed, and can be applied to content from around the world. They’re developed in consultation with a wide range of external industry and policy experts, as well as YouTube Creators. New policies go through multiple rounds of testing before they go live to ensure our global team of content reviewers can apply them accurately and consistently.
This work is never finished, and we are always evaluating our policies to understand how we can better strike a balance between keeping the YouTube community protected and giving everyone a voice.

How does YouTube enforce its Community Guidelines?
500 hours of video are uploaded to YouTube every minute. That’s a lot of content, which is why our teams come together to make sure that what you see on our platform follows our Community Guidelines. To do that, we combine the power of advanced machine learning systems and our community itself to flag potentially problematic content. Our expert reviewers then remove flagged content that violates our Community Guidelines.

How does YouTube identify content that violates Community Guidelines?
With hundreds of hours of new content uploaded to YouTube every minute, we use a combination of people and machine learning to detect problematic content at scale. Machine learning is well-suited to detect patterns, which helps us to find content similar to other content we’ve already removed, even before it’s viewed.
We also recognize that the best way to quickly remove content is to anticipate problems before they emerge. Our Intelligence Desk monitors the news, social media, and user reports to detect new trends surrounding inappropriate content, and works to make sure our teams are prepared to address them before they can become a larger issue.
Is there a way for the broader community to flag harmful content?
The YouTube community also plays an important role in flagging content they think is inappropriate.
If you see content that you think violates Community Guidelines, you can useour flagging featureto submit content for review.
If you see content that you think violates Community Guidelines, you can useour flagging featureto submit content for review.
We developed theYouTube Trusted Flagger programto provide robust content reporting processes to non-governmental organizations (NGOs) with expertise in a policy area and government agencies. Participants receive training on YouTube policies and have a direct path of communication with our Trust & Safety specialists. Videos flagged by Trusted Flaggers are not automatically removed. They are subject to the same human review as videos flagged by any other user, but we may expedite review by our teams. NGOs also receive occasional online training on YouTube policies.

How does YouTube treat educational, documentary, scientific, or artistic content?
Sometimes videos that might otherwise violate our Community Guidelines may be allowed to stay on YouTube if the content offers a compelling reason with visible context for viewers. We often refer to this exception as “EDSA,” which stands for “Educational, Documentary, Scientific or Artistic”. To help determine whether a video might qualify for an EDSA exception, we look at multiple factors, including the video title, descriptions, and the context provided.
EDSA exceptions are a critical way we make sure that important speech stays on YouTube, while protecting the wider YouTube ecosystem from harmful content.

Read more about how we treat EDSA content on YouTube
What action does YouTube take for content that violates Community Guidelines?
Machine learning systems help us identify and remove spam automatically, as well as remove re-uploads of content we’ve already reviewed and determined violates our policies. YouTube takes action on other flagged videos after review by trained human reviewers. They assess whether the content does indeed violate our policies, and protect content that has an educational, documentary, scientific, or artistic purpose. Our reviewer teams remove content that violates our policies and age-restrict content that may not be appropriate for all audiences. Reviewers' inputs are then used to train and improve the accuracy of our systems at a much larger scale.

Community Guidelines Strikes
If our reviewers decide that content violates our Community Guidelines, we remove the content and send a notice to the Creator. The first time a Creator violates our Community Guidelines, they receive a warning with no penalty to the channel. After one warning, we’ll issue a Community Guidelines strike to the channel and the account will have temporary restrictions including not being allowed to upload videos, live streams, or stories for a 1-week period. Channels that receive three strikes within a 90-day period will be terminated. Channels that are dedicated to violating our policies or that have a single case of severe abuse of the platform, will bypass our strikes system and be terminated. All strikes and terminations can be appealed if the Creator believes there was an error, and our teams will re-review the decision.

Appeal a Community Guidelines strike
Age-Restricting Content
Sometimes content doesn't violate our Community Guidelines, but may not be appropriate for viewers under 18 years of age. In these cases, our review team will place an age restriction on the video so it will not be visible to viewers under 18 years of age, logged-out users, or to those who haveRestricted Modeenabled. Creators can also choose toage restrict their own contentat upload if they think it’s not suitable for younger audiences.

YouTube policies
Impersonation policy
Impersonation policy
Content intended to impersonate a person or channel is not allowed on YouTube. YouTube also enforces trademark holder rights. When a channel, or content in the channel, causes confusion about the source of goods and services advertised, it may not be allowed.
If you see content that violates this policy,report it.
If you feel that yours or another creator's channel is being impersonated, you canreport the channel.
What these policies mean for you
If you're posting content
Don’t post content on YouTube if it fits any of the descriptions noted below.
Channel impersonation:A channel that copies another channel's profile, background, or overall look and feel in such a way that makes it look like someone else's channel. The channel does not have to be 100% identical, as long as the intent is clear to copy the other channel.
Personal impersonation:Content intended to look like someone else is posting it.
If you operate a fan channel, make sure you state so explicitly in your channel name orhandle. It should be obvious to your viewers that your channel doesn't represent the original creator, artist or entity your channel is celebrating.
Examples
Here are some examples of content that’s not allowed on YouTube.
Channels with the same identifier (channel name or handle) and image as another channel, with the only difference being a space inserted into the name or a zero replacing the letter O.
Using someone else's real name, user name, image, brand, logo, or other personal information to trick people into believing you are that person.
Setting up a channel using the same identifier (channel name or handle) and image of a person, and then pretending that person is posting content to the channel.
Setting up a channel using the name and image of a person, and then posting comments on other channels as if they were posted by the person.
Channels claiming to be a 'fan account' in the channel description, but not stating so clearly in the channel name or handle, or posing as another’s channel and reuploading their content.
Channels impersonating an existing news channel.
Remember these are just some examples, and don't post content if you think it might violate this policy.
What happens if content violates this policy
If your content violates this policy, we may terminate your channel or account. Learn more aboutchannel or account terminations.

Pomona Student Jobs
Pomona College was established in 1887 on a campus designed to recreate the best of the eastern Ivy League universities, while at the same time offering the beautiful Southern California lifestyle. Located in Claremont, CA, Pomona has approximately 1,500 undergraduate students and a student to faculty ratio of 8 to 1.
Rather than growing beyond our small college roots, we later chose Oxford and Cambridge as our model for founding The Claremont Colleges, a consortium of seven independent institutions on adjoining campuses unlike any other higher education experience in America.
We are continually ranked among the best colleges in the nation on Kiplinger's Personal Finance, The Princeton Review, and the Fiske Guide to Colleges. We inspire our students to take risks and we support them in their mission to make a real difference in the world.
We seek to engage and reward our employees who are professionals of the highest caliber and quality, who value our College’s intimate community and historic roots, and who contribute to the ethics, talents and excellence of our administration and faculty in a collaborative environment of equal opportunity, intellectual development, personal growth, and liberal arts education that leads the nation and the world.
Equal Opportunity Employer
Pomona College prides itself in being an open, competitive, and equal opportunity employer. The College is committed to a policy of equal employment opportunities for all applicants and employees and complies with all applicable state and federal laws on the matter. The College does not unlawfully discriminate on the basis of race, color, creed, religion, national or ethnic origin, ancestry, sex, age, sexual orientation, gender identity and expression, marital status, pregnancy, physical or mental disability, medical condition, family care leave status, veteran's status, or any other category described in Pomona College’s Nondiscrimination Policy or protected by law.
For further information please call (909) 621-8175 or inquire at theHuman Resources Office.
Clery Disclosure
Pomona College publishes an Annual Security and Fire Safety Report pursuant to the Jeanne Clery Disclosure of Campus Security Policy and Campus Crime Statistics Act. The report contains information regarding campus security and personal safety including topics such as: crime prevention, fire safety, crime reporting policies, disciplinary procedures and other matters of importance related to security and safety on campus. The report also contains information about crime statistics for the three previous calendar years concerning reported crimes that occurred on campus; in certain off-campus buildings or property owned or controlled by Pomona; and on public property within, or immediately adjacent to and accessible from the campus. ThePomona College Annual Security and Fire Safety Report is available in PDF format. The College will provide a paper copy of the report upon request.

This experience will continue to guide their contributions as the next generation of leaders, scholars, artists and engaged members of society to fulfill the vision of the College’s founders: to bear their added riches in trust for all.

Claremont Stories – What to See and Do

“About 30 miles east of downtown Los Angeles, and joined to it by Interstate 10 and Metrolink trains, Claremont is, geographically, a Los Angeles suburb. Spiritually, it’s distinct.”~ Sunset Magazine




Claremont is a hidden gem in greater Los Angeles — a quintessential college town with tree-lined streets and stunning historic architecture. It is an ideal destination for romantic weekend getaways and mini-family vacations alike.
Visitors will find a walkable downtown village of locally owned boutiques and restaurants, inviting guest rooms, a burgeoning local craft beer and spirits scene, public art, and vivid examples of early and modernist California architecture throughout the city and seven college campuses. With 5 hotel choices to fit most any budget and need, Claremont is a smart getaway.

The Women's Union
Women's Union
The mission of the Pomona College Women’s Union is to secure positive changes for women in their personal and political lives and to work toward deconstructing gender-based constraints within both local and global contexts. We will engage The Claremont Colleges while extending our reach into our surrounding communities. The Women’s Union is committed to providing space and programming involving all genders, tailored to the diverse needs of women. In order to fulfill these commitments, we will exercise an active position against interlocking systems of oppression based on, but not limited to, race, ethnicity, sex, gender, sexual orientation, class, religion, and ability.

A Strong Launch into Life
Pomona College is a close-knit and diverse community of accomplished scholars, scientists, entrepreneurs and artists who are passionate about making a difference in the world.
Intellectual Opportunity
Classes are small, so students and faculty can build close relationships, delve into research and explore across academic fields. More than half of all Pomona students work closely with professors in research projects, receiving academic and financial support for a deeper approach to learning.
WATCH: Faculty and Student Research
The Power of Place
More than 90% of our students live on campus here in Southern California all four years, and many professors live within five miles of campus. New collaborations or discussions can spring up anywhere – a residence hall, club meeting or at lunch with a professor.
Living at Pomona
Center for Global Engagement
Engaging with the wider world is central to the Pomona College experience. In the years ahead, a new Center for Global Engagement will rise at the heart of our campus.

Incidents at Carnegie Hall and the Road Ahead
Incidents at Carnegie Hall and the Road Ahead
Dear Pomona College community,
As we head into fall break, I write with the hope that you will take care of yourselves and one another, because we need one another, and we need care, as the violation of our collective life on campus on October 7, 2024, has shown.
The takeover of Carnegie Hall and the events that ensued should be unfathomable in a close-knit, ethical, and caring learning community such as ours. Our academic mission was directly targeted. Faculty, students, staff, and high-school student visitors were subjected to intimidation and fear. This is unacceptable.
I am grateful to the members of our community who, in the midst of crisis, have stood up for who we are at our best. My deepest appreciation to the campus safety staff who stayed with other members of our community throughout the day; to the student affairs staff who worked to de-escalate the situation and to bring help; to the faculty, staff and students who helped others evacuate the building; to the faculty from around campus and the leadership of CGU, who answered the call to provide classroom and office space for displaced faculty; to the members of ASPC who held a letter-writing campaign offering support to Carnegie faculty and staff; to the facilities and ITS staff who have labored to restore the building; and to the staff, faculty, and students who have worked to find a path that is true to who we are: Thank you.
Thank you to all of you who have, through your actions and your care, continued to elevate what is best in us, and to show what our community stands for: compassion, care, and a belief in the power of education to unleash human potential.
I grieve, alongside so many of you, thatthe destruction in Carnegie Hall was extensiveand the harm to individuals and our mission was so great. I want you all to know that, based on our extensive but still growing inquiry,the vast majority of those who occupied Carnegie are not Pomona students. Starting this week, disciplinary letters are going out to students from Pomona and the other Claremont Colleges who have been identified as taking part in the takeover of Carnegie Hall. Student groups affiliated with this incident are also under investigation. Individuals who are not students will be banned from our campus. Additional evidence is still under review. It is important that everyone understand that Pomona is committed to the integrity of our disciplinary processes, and we will be unable to comment on individual cases. I anticipate that, within the scope of the student code, and commensurate with individual circumstances, sanctions will range widely, including campus bans, suspension and expulsion—a step we do not take lightly. As always, we have due process on our campus, with opportunities for appeal.
Every Sagehen, as the executive committee of our faculty so eloquently wrote, has a role to play in rebuilding our sense of collective responsibility, and in finding a path forward that restores our community.
Pomona College isn’t just any kind of community, though. It is in our love for creativity, in our thirst for discovery, in our commitment to intellectual depth and rigor, and in the fruits of our labor, that Pomona makes our greatest mark in the world, and it is on this that we stake our greatest hopes.
This is why we are here, and not any of the other places any of us could be.
As we head into the final months of the semester and the year, let us embrace this commitment together. Let us not lose sight of what unites and makes us strong. We are given great gifts, gifts that we must bear in trust for this generation and every generation to come. I am proud to be part of this community, and I look forward to being with you, engaging alongside you, and setting our feet together on a path that, even at our most profound moments of disagreement, leads to higher ground.
With fervent hopes for peace in this world, and with love for you and what we do, I remain,

G. Gabrielle Starr

Life at Pomona
Living at Pomona
Pomona’s 140-acre campus is designed to offer students a beautiful landscape in which to live, learn and discover.
Our Residence Halls
Dining on Campus
Living in Claremont
Ninety-four percent of our students live on campus all four years, and many professors live within five miles of campus. This creates a close-knit community where new collaborations or eye-opening discussions can spring up anywhere – a dorm, club meeting, or at lunch with a professor.
Pomona will be your home for four years – that’s four years of forging connections, making lifelong friends, and learning and discovering new passions.
If you consider our campus a hub, we have some pretty amazing spokes: The Claremont Colleges has more than 6,000+ students you can meet through 250+ clubs and 2,000+ classes. We’re nestled in Southern California, a natural and cultural playground you can explore on day trips, field trips and internships. You may even take your Pomona experience global with study abroad or international research and internships.
Clubs & Activities
You will never be bored at Pomona. With Southern California at your doorstep and more than 200 clubs and dozens of weekly events at The Claremont Colleges, you’ll always find something new to explore.

A Better World
We encourage all our students to become educated, responsible citizens of the world through volunteering and community partnership opportunities, leadership training, and ways to live sustainably.

Campus Events
Scholars, artists and authors, like Chimamanda Adichie (Americanah), speak on campus and even meet with students.
The Claremont Colleges Ballroom Dance Company often puts on performances and formal balls.
Nearly every day you are on campus, there is an event to attend: small department gatherings, sporting events, big concerts atBig Bridges, film screenings, lectures, trip around SoCal, discussions, art exhibits… and that’s just on the Pomona College campus.
It’s difficult to calculate the amount of events in one semester, so here’s a brief, not-exhaustive list of events in a recent spring semester week:
A prize-winning historian and author lecturing on "Herman Melville and Slavery" and "Henry Ford and Capitalism"
Holi, the Hindu festival of colors
Several film screenings with filmmakers in attendance
Student discussions on the presidential election, the U.S.-Mexico drug trade, and the sociology of monogamy
Contra dance and ballroom dance lessons
Conferences on criminal justice, disability issues, and Haitian art
Lectures on pre-modern Buddhism, pesticide use and environmental justice in Central America, the poet Wallace Stevens, public interest ethnography, California and climate change, 18th-century Cherokee women's diplomacy, trans justice, antimicrobial peptides, and the historical roots of the banjo
New theatre productions
Concerts and recitalsby students, faculty and guest artists
Art exhibitions
Dance nights with DJs and Art After Hours, which is a Museum event with music
Severalathletic eventslike water polo and basketball
“47 Things” trips to see a musical in Orange County, Griffith Observatory, the L.A. County Museum of Art, the Aquarium of the Pacific, and L.A. Clippers and L.A. Kings games
Like clubs, many of these events are student-driven. The live bands playing at Art After Hours are usually student-led. The Black Hair conference, now a few years old, was started by a student. Students organize DJ nights at Doms Lounge in the Smith Campus Center, and collaborate with the Museum of Art on their weekly Art After Hours event series.
Or, you may find yourself holding a game night in your residence hall suite or meeting up with your sponsor group to have dinner on another campus. Your options are plentiful. Visit ourEvents Calendarto see what's happening soon!

Becoming a Leader
Becoming a Leader
Orientation Adventure trips are led by older students – just one of many ways you can gain training and experience in leadership at Pomona.
Pomona students are driven, motivated and passionate about using their talents to the fullest extent, and Pomona College is equally driven to provide opportunities for our students to gain the leadership skills that will help them after they graduate.
Meet Alejandro Guerrero '19, 2018-2019 president of the Associated Students of Pomona College (ASPC), and learn about what inspired him to serve youth in the city of Pomona.
Pomona graduates have gone on to prominent leadership roles in many fields and sectors, including but not limited to politics, academia, non-profit, technology, medicine and more.
Pomona offers students with a variety of opportunities to develop their leadership skills in the areas of student government, student-run groups, residence hall and sponsors, outdoor education, academic research, community service projects, peer counseling, on-campus jobs and off-campus internships – and much more.
At Pomona, leadership is about being socially responsible. It’s accessible to anyone. It’s a path, not a position.

Jobs and Internships
Jobs and Internships
Residential Advisor is one of many jobs that students can seek during their four years at Pomona.
Students work in all types of internships during the academic year and in summer, including nonprofit organizations like Asylum Access.
Another way Pomona students get involved and test out career paths is internships and on-campus jobs.
Each student has an annual allotment of hours that they can work on campus, and the variety of jobs is large enough that you can hone a personal talent, explore a new interest, or just seek an interesting position.
On-campus jobs include (but aren’t limited to):
leading Orientation Adventure trips,
being a sponsor or a residential advisor,
working at the Coop Fountain or Coop Store,
assisting an office like Communications or the Dean of Students,
coordinating community outreach and partnership programs in the Draper Center,
working at the Museum, Admissions Office, or in Athletics,
or being an academic department liaison.
Students can look for jobs usingHandshake via our Career Development Office. For more information on student employment and work allotments at Pomona, visit ourjobs page in Financial Aid.
You can also seekinternshipsduring the academic year or summer. Pomona helps fund this real-world education for students who can’t afford unpaid work by providing stipends and commuting/travel assistance.
Los Angeles and our local communities offer many opportunities during the school year, and some students intern internationally while on study abroad or in the summer.
Our students have interned everywhere from the U.S. federal government and PricewaterhouseCoopers to Warner Brothers Records and UNAIDS.

Students have the opportunity to enact lasting change on campus through the President’s Sustainability Fund.
Each year, the dorms are “swept” for items left behind that are then sold to new students at the ReCoop sale.
Pomona students give back by lessening what they take. From the dining halls to the residence halls, Pomona helps students live sustainably.
In the dining halls, we offer healthy food, locally sourced whenever possible. We got rid of trays to lessen food waste and encourage students to compost, which we use down on ourOrganic Farm. Students distribute leftover food to local homeless organizations.
You can check-outlaundry racks and compost bucketsfor your dorm. Annually, dorms compete against one another and the other Claremont Colleges through aPowerDowncompetition to reduce energy use. OurGreen Bikesprogram offers a limited amount of free bikes each year and will teach you to maintain your own bike.
Students participate in these efforts via our clubs and organizations– running Green Bikes, planting native gardens, working on environmental justice issues, andsweeping dormsfor leftover items to resell, donate and ultimately save from landfills.
Each year in the fall, students can apply for a sustainability project to be funded through thePresident’s Sustainability Fund– a great way for students to lead long-lasting change on campus. Past projects include the drying rack program, residential composting, a 24-hour bicycle repair station, water bottle refill stations, and a mobile solar power station.
Sustainability is in our classrooms too. Through ourEnvironmental Analysis program, students can explore a wide variety of issues, from the science side of things to environmental justice, history, or the built environment. Even if you’re not an EA major, one of these classes can fulfill your general education (we call them “breadth of study”) requirements.
Finally, Pomona as an institution has a deep commitment tosustainability. We’ve pledged to be carbon neutral by 2030. All new buildings must meet LEED-Gold standards. We capture rainwater to return it to the aquifer, encourage alternative transportation, find ways to reduce energy use on campus, and replace landscapes with drought-resistant plants. Join the movement!

President's Advisory Committee on Sustainability
President's Advisory Committee on Sustainability
In Fall 2006, Pomona College President David Oxtoby established the President's Advisory Committee on Sustainability (PACS). The committee consists of faculty, staff, and students and meets biweekly during the academic year. This committee is responsible for:
Reviewing and monitoring campus operations that directly affect the College's use of resources
Creating campus sustainability reports to assess progress
Developing strategies, outreach, and programs for increasing campus sustainability
Administering the President's Sustainability Fund
President's Sustainability Fund
PACS administers the yearly President's Sustainability Fund. These projects must focus on infrastructural or operational changes instead of outreach- or education-focused efforts.
For a list of recent projects, please see our page onreceiving funding for projects.

SAVE Annual Report

Sustainability Strategic Plan
Pomona College's sustainability strategic plan,SAVE: Sustainable Action Visible Effects, outlines goals and strategies for achieving ambitious sustainability goals and for reaching carbon neutrality by 2030. SAVE aligns the work and direction of The Board of Trustees, the President, the President's Advisory Committee on Sustainability, and the Pomona community.
Sustainability Dashboard
The SAVE sustainability strategic plan has nine key categories with 2030 goals for creating and managing a sustainable campus community. Three categories are highlighted below: climate, energy and water. These goals are updated monthly to show current progress. View our SAVE Annual Report to see goals, progress, and initiatives from all nine of our sustainability categories.
Key Sustainability Metrics
reduction in GHG emissions. 2030 Goal: Carbon Neutrality with a 50% reduction in energy emissions. (Updated: July 2023)
Key Sustainability Metrics
reduction in energy use. 2030 Goal: 40% reduction. (Updated: Sept. 2023)
reduction in water use. 2030 Goal: 60% reduction. (Updated: Oct. 2023)
waste diversion rate. 2030 Goal: 90% diversion. (Updated: July 2023)
All goals are compared to a baseline from fiscal year 2014.
SAVE Annual Report
The Sustainability Office publishes a SAVE Annual Report every October to share updates on key initiatives and progress towards the goals. The report is designed by a team of summer student interns and is published via Tableau for a fully online, accessible and interactive experience. From the overview page, click on one of the nine key categories (like Climate or Energy) to view goal performance, data visualizations, and program updates.

EcoReps— Creating a sustainable Pomona.
EcoNews Bulletin
Pomona EcoReps serve the Pomona College community as a student-run sustainability hub. They aim to promote sustainable practices on campus by connecting students to information, resources, funding, and the Pomona College administration. EcoReps believe that everyone has something unique to contribute to the conversation and that environmentalism requires a community-based culture of awareness, care, and engagement.
The EcoReps promote energy- and water-saving, low-waste living, sustainable eating, and alternative transportation through tangible ways like leading trips to the local Farmers Market, cooking plant-based dinners, composting, hosting the Free Room Flea Markets, facilitating panels on current events, and more.
For more information, emailecoreps@pomona.edu, follow on social media (InstagramandFacebook) or subscribe to theirEcoNews Bulletin.

We'd like to feature Cecilia Muecke and her awesome work at the Pomona Farm! The Farm is a working farm available for the college community to find their personal connection to the environment. The sustainably grown food at the Farm gets donated to the community and organizations like the Uncommon Good nonprofit. Cecilia Muecke (PO '25) got involved with the Farm by volunteering during her first semester at Pomona. Since then, she has been involved at the Farm in various capacities. She spent her sophomore summer doing a Summer Undergraduate Research Program fellowship at the Farm. Cecilia is now a Farm Assistant at the Pomona Organic Farm and co-leads the Farm Club! In Cecilia’s eyes, the Farm is “all about getting people outside, connecting with themselves, each other, and the land.”By collaborating with her, we were able to host our "Freshman Flock to the Farm" event, where we made pizzas! See below!

Our “Freshmen Flock to the Farm” event on Wednesday, November 1st, organized by EcoReps Sydney and Gina, Cecilia, and the rest of the Farm Club, was a prime example of this community engagement. Over 25 freshmen flocked to the farm to make their own personal organic pizzas, customizing the pies with yummy farm-grown ingredients like tomatoes, bell peppers, jalapeños, arugula, basil, and oregano while sipping fresh mint tea and enjoying the serenity of the farm.
There are many other exciting developments at the farm. Farm Manager Jill Gomez and Student Compost Drivers are working hard for the Farm and take “a leadership role in composting all of Pomona's food waste as [the Farm] transition[s] away from industrial composting.” Another Farm Club member, Anna Parrott, is planning a spirit-building event for students and EA faculty at the farm on November 16th from 4:15-6:15 pm with a regathering at 7:30. The purpose of this event, called Collective Horizons, is to discuss and envision hope in a future with climate change. After dinner, attendees will regather around a campfire at 7:30 to tell campfire stories, poems, and enjoy s’mores!

Sensitivities vs. Allergies
What is the difference between food allergy, food sensitivity and food intolerance?
Food allergies, food sensitivities and food intolerance are often used interchangeably and inappropriately. In fact, there is active debate in scientific and medical circles as to how to define and use these three terms. The general consensus is that food allergy can be defined as any adverse reaction to food that involves our immune system. This further breaks down into two kinds of reactions, food allergy and food sensitivity. Food intolerance does not involve the immune system.
Food Allergy:
Perhaps the best known example of food allergy is also its least common and most dangerous. Anaphylactic shock is a severe hyper-reaction of the immune system caused by a massive release of histamine and other chemical mediators from certain types of white blood cells called mast cells and basophils. Not everyone with food allergies experiences anaphylaxis though. The immunological triggering mechanism that causes the mast cells (and basophils) to release their chemicals is called IgE and is a very well understood phenomenon. This underlying mechanism is considerably different from the triggering mechanisms found in food sensitivities. The most common foods implicated in food allergy are peanuts, other nuts, shellfish or foods containing sulfites. People with anaphylaxis can die within minutes if they ingest even one molecule of their allergic food.
Food Sensitivity:
Food sensitivity (also known as delayed food allergy) is quite another story. Delayed reactions manifest in many different ways as they can affect any organ system in the body and can take from 45 minutes to several days for symptoms to become apparent. The delayed onset of symptoms and complex physiological mechanisms involved in food sensitivities make them an especially difficult puzzle to try to solve either on your own or with most laboratory serum tests. In fact, food sensitivities often go undiagnosed or misdiagnosed. The treatments prescribed usually provide only temporary relief that mask the symptoms instead of addressing the root cause of the problems.
The differences between the two kinds of immune-mediated adverse food reactions are summarized in the table below.
Food Intolerance:
Food intolerance can produce some digestive symptoms that are similar to food sensitivity but it doesn't involve the immune system. Instead, when the food in question is consumed, it is not properly digested and begins to ferment inside the gut. The best example of food intolerance is lactose intolerance. This condition is characterized by bloating, loose stools or diarrhea and gas. Lactose intolerance is caused by an inability of the body to produce enough of the enzyme lactase, which breaks down lactose, the primary sugar found in milk. Avoiding milk products or supplementing the diet with lactase enzyme is the best way for a person with lactose intolerance to overcome the problem.

Meet the Nutritionist
Meet the Nutritionist: Liz Ryan
Liz is thrilled to be a part of the Dining Services team as your nutrition guidance counselor. While ensuring there are nutritious and delicious foods available every day, she would also like to help you make healthier choices. Available for one-on-one nutrition counseling (free of charge to students!), she is happy to discuss specific health needs or goals.  She will work with you to develop strategies to implement a reasonable plan that works for you and compliments your lifestyle. Throughout the year, Liz will offer workshops on topics such as general nutrition, health information, nutrition for athletes, vegetarianism, weight and obesity, heart health, organic foods and cooking.
Liz isn't new to Pomona; she graduated with a degree in Anthropology in 1988. She went on to a career in real estate, before becoming a full-time mom.  Knowing she would want to return to the workforce, she went back to school and pursued nutrition, a field that was always of interest to her.  In 2010, she obtained her designation as a DTR (Dietetic Technician, Registered) with the state of California.
You can get in touch with Liz by emailing her atnutritionist@pomona.edu.

Nutrition 101
TheHealthy Eating Plate, created by nutrition experts at Harvard School of Public Health and editors at Harvard Health Publications, was designed to address deficiencies in the U.S. Department of Agriculture (USDA)’s MyPlate. The Healthy Eating Plate provides detailed guidance, in a simple format, to help people make the best eating choices.
Use The Healthy Eating Plate as a guide for creating healthy, balanced meals.
Serving sizes can help you determine more appropriate portion size, and learning what the standard serving sizes are can help you better estimate how much food and how many calories you are eating. Portion distortion – massive servings of food we get at restaurants, and maybe even at home – is commonplace, and most of us probably don’t know what a true portion size looks like. Learn more aboutportion sizes. Portion control is one of the keys to a healthier diet and a healthier lifestyle.  Eliminate the confusion and gain some control!
Nutrition and diet information is constantly evolving, but here are some nutrition basics to keep in mind.
Make most of your mealvegetables and fruits– ½ of your plate:Aim for color and variety, and remember that potatoes don't count as vegetables on the Healthy Eating Plate because of their negative impact on blood sugar.
Go for whole grains – ¼ of your plate:Whole and intactgrains—whole wheat, barley, wheat berries, quinoa, oats, brown rice, and foods made with them, such as whole wheat pasta—have a milder effect on blood sugar and insulin than white bread, white rice, and other refined grains.
Protein power – ¼ of your plate:Fish, chicken, beans, and nuts are all healthy, versatileproteinsources—they can be mixed into salads, and pair well with vegetables on a plate. Limit red meat, and avoid processed meats such as bacon and sausage.
Healthy plant oils – in moderation:Choosehealthy vegetable oilslike olive, canola, soy, corn, sunflower, peanut, and others, and avoid partially hydrogenated oils, which contain unhealthy trans fats. Remember thatlow-fat does not mean “healthy.”
Drink water, coffee, or tea:Skipsugary drinks, limit milk and dairy products to one to two servings per day, and limit juice to a small glass per day.
Stay active:The red figure running across the Healthy Eating Plate's placemat is a reminder thatstaying activeis also important inweightcontrol.
The main message of the Healthy Eating Plate is tofocus on diet quality.
Thetype of carbohydratein the diet is more important than theamount of carbohydratein the diet, because some sources of carbohydrate—like vegetables (other thanpotatoes), fruits, whole grains, and beans—are healthier than others.
The Healthy Eating Plate also advises consumers to avoidsugary beverages, a major source of calories—usually with little nutritional value—in the American diet.
The Healthy Eating Plate encourages consumers to usehealthy oils, and it does not set a maximum on the percentage of calories people should get each day from healthy sources of fat. In this way, the Healthy Eating Plate recommends the opposite of the low-fat message promoted for decades by the USDA.

Fats and Cholesterol
When it comes to dietary fat, what matters most is the type of fat you eat. Contrary to past dietary advice promotinglow-fat diets, newer research shows that healthy fats are necessary and beneficial for health.
When food manufacturers reduce fat, they often replace it withcarbohydratesfrom sugar, refined grains, or other starches. Our bodies digest these refined carbohydrates and starches very quickly, affectingblood sugarand insulin levels and possibly resulting in weight gain and disease. (1-3)
Findings from the Nurses’ Health Study (4) and the Health Professionals Follow-up Study (5) show that no link between the overall percentage of calories from fat and any important health outcome, including cancer, heart disease, and weight gain.
Rather than adopting a low-fat diet, it’s more important to focus on eating beneficial “good” fats and avoiding harmful “bad” fats. Fat is an important part of a healthy diet. Choose foods with “good” unsaturated fats, limit foods high in saturated fat, and avoid “bad” trans fat.
“Good” unsaturated fats —Monounsaturated and polyunsaturated fats — lower disease risk. Foods high in good fats include vegetable oils (such as olive, canola, sunflower, soy, and corn), nuts, seeds, and fish.
“Bad” fats —trans fats — increase disease risk, even when eaten in small quantities. Foods containing trans fats are primarily in processed foods made with trans fat from partially hydrogenated oil. Fortunately, trans fats have been eliminated from many of these foods.
Saturated fats, while not as harmful as trans fats, by comparison with unsaturated fats negatively impact health and are best consumed in moderation. Foods containing large amounts of saturated fat include red meat, butter, cheese, and ice cream. Some plant-based fats likecoconut oiland palm oil are also rich in saturated fat.
When you cut back on foods like red meat and butter, replace them with fish, beans, nuts, and healthy oils instead of refined carbohydrates.

Body Fat
Role of Body Fat
We may not appreciate body fat, especially when it accumulates in specific areas like our bellies or thighs. But fat is an important source of stored energy when we can’t get to food for an extended time. Within the matrix of body fat, also called adipose tissue, there is not only fat cells but nerve and immune cells and connective tissue. [2] Fat tissue releases hormones that control metabolism and appetite (i.e., leptin, adiponectin) and that affect insulin sensitivity (i.e., tumor necrosis factor-alpha, interleukin-6). Macrophages, neutrophils, and eosinophils are some of the immune cells found in fat tissue that play a role in inflammation—both anti-inflammatory and proinflammatory. Fat cells also secrete proteins and build enzymes involved with immune function and the creation of steroid hormones.
Fat cells can grow in size and number. The amount of fat cells in our bodies is determined soon after birth and during adolescence, and tends to be stable throughout adulthood if weight remains fairly stable. [3] But eating too many calories in the long-term can cause fat cells to increase in size and be stored in various areas throughout the body, which leads to a risk of chronic inflammation and glitches in healthy metabolism, with the potential for new fat cells to grow. These larger fat cells become resistant to insulin, which increases the risk of type 2 diabetes and cardiovascular disease. Weight loss can reduce the size of fat cells but not the number.
Obesity, defined as an excessive amount of body fat, is a common and expensive medical condition in the U.S., strongly associated with an increased risk ofheart disease, stroke,type 2 diabetes, and certain types ofcancer, as well as premature deaths from these diseases. [1] Learning about the actions and different types of body fat may increase understanding of this condition.
Types of Body Fat
Fat tissue comes in white, brown, beige, and even pink. [2] Some are necessary for good health.
Types
Brown fat– Infants carry the most brown fat, which keeps them warm. It is stimulated by cold temperatures to generate heat. The amount of brown fat does not change with increased calorie intake, and those who have overweight or obesity tend to carry less brown fat than lean persons.
White fat– These large round cells are the most abundant type and are designed for fat storage, accumulating in the belly, thighs, and hips. They secrete more than 50 types of hormones, enzymes, and growth factors including leptin and adiponectin, which helps the liver and muscles respond better to insulin (a blood sugar regulator). But if there are excessive white cells, these hormones are disrupted and can cause the opposite effect of insulin resistance and chronic inflammation.
Beige fat– This type of white fat can be converted to perform similar traits as brown fat, such as being able to generate heat with exposure to cold temperatures or during exercise.
Pink fat– This type of white fat is converted to pink during pregnancy and lactation, producing and secreting breast milk.
Essential fat– This type may be made up of brown, white, or beige fat and is vital for the body to function normally. It is found in most organs, muscles, and the central nervous system including the brain. It helps to regulate hormones like estrogen, insulin, cortisol, and leptin; control body temperature; and assist in the absorption of vitamins and minerals. When a person’s body fat dips below a certain level (about less than 5% in men and less than 10% in women), there may not be enough essential fat to perform these functions.
Location
Subcutaneous– You can pinch this layer of fat that sits directly underneath the skin’s surface, cushioning the bones and joints. It’s the body’s most abundant type of fat and tends to accumulate around the waist, hips, upper back, buttocks, and thighs. Very high amounts of subcutaneous fat can increase the risk of disease, though not as significantly as visceral fat.
Visceral– An excess of this type of white fat is sometimes referred to as “belly fat” or “central obesity,” as it accumulates deep in the abdominal cavity, wrapping around digestive organs like the pancreas, intestines, and liver but also the heart. Having a lot of visceral fat is linked with a higher risk of cardiovascular disease, diabetes, and certain cancers. It may secrete inflammatory chemicals called cytokines that promote insulin resistance.
How do I get rid of belly fat?
Measuring Body Fat
Obesity, or body fatness, is calculated with various methods that range in accuracy and have limitations. Combining two or more methods, if possible, may better predict if someone has increased health risks related to weight.
Body Mass Index (BMI)
Why use BMI?
One of the most widely used tools for estimating excess fat is the body mass index (BMI). BMI only measures excess weight, calculating a ratio of one’s weight to height. [4] However, research has shown that BMI often correlates with “gold standard” direct measures of fat mass and fat-free mass such as underwater weighing (hydrostatic weighing) and dual X-ray absorptiometry (DEXA). In comparison with these methods that require expensive equipment, BMI is noninvasive, easy to calculate, and can be used anywhere.
Because of its simplicity and widespread use, BMI is often used when studying populations. Researchers can compare the BMI of groups of people over time in different areas, to screen for obesity and its related health risks.
BMI does have several limitations. It can’t measure location of fat (e.g., belly fat is linked with greater health risks), muscle mass, or bone mass—all of which contribute to weight. One’s age, sex, race, and ethnicity can also affect BMI. [4] For example, when comparing two people with the same BMI:
Women genetically have more body fat and less muscle mass than men.
Highly trained athletes may have a high BMI from increased muscle mass but little body fat.
Older adults tend to carry more body fat than younger adults.
While BMI and weight tend to decline in the elderly, visceral abdominal fat may continue to increase. [5]
Men and women with larger body frames may have a higher weight from greater (heavier) bone mass rather than fat mass.
Some studies have found that Black individuals have less body fat and more lean muscle than other ethnicities at the same BMI. However, Blacks and Hispanics have the highest rates of obesity in the U.S., so the overall burden of obesity-related diseases is still higher in these groups.
For these reasons, BMI might be used as ascreeningtool for potential weight-related problems rather than to diagnose certain conditions. The accuracy of BMI in predicting health risk may vary across different individuals and racial and ethnic groups.  Some populations have higher rates of obesity but that do not have corresponding rates of metabolic diseases like diabetes, and vice versa. [3] For instance, Southeast Asians can have a normal BMI but be metabolically unhealthy.
BMI might be supplemented with other measures such as waist circumference or waist-hip ratio that better assess fat distribution.
How to determine BMI
Divide your weight in pounds by your height in inches.
Divide the answer by your height in inches.
Multiply the answer by 703.
You can also use the National Heart, Lung and Blood Institute’sonline BMI calculatoror simpleBMI tables.
Interpreting the BMI number
The World Health Organization defines a “normal” weight as a BMI of 18.5 to 24.9, “overweight or pre-obesity” as a BMI of 25.0 to 29.9, and “obesity” as a BMI of 30 or higher. It further classifies levels of obesity as Class I (BMI 30.0 to 34.9), Class II (BMI 35.0 to 39.9), and Class III (BMI 40 or higher). (6)
At a population level, a high BMI is generally associated with an increased risk of disease and early death. Many studies have shown that a BMI above 25 increases the chances of dying early compared to those with normal weight:A meta-analysis published in theNew England Journal of Medicineshowed a clear relationship between BMI and mortality, where both people with underweight (BMI <18.5) and with overweight and obesity (BMI >25) had greater mortality. [7] The lowest death rate from any cause was associated with the BMI range between 22.5 and 24.9. To address some methodological flaws in previous studies, this study excluded smokers who tend to have lower weight due to smoking, individuals with cancer and heart disease who might have lost weight due to these conditions, and individuals over the age of 85 who could have a normal BMI but suffer from frailty or other age-related unhealthy weight loss.Another large meta-analysis inThe Lancetthat looked at data across four continents found that for every five units higher of a BMI above 25, risk of premature death increased by about 31%. [8] The study also looked at specific causes of death, and found that for each 5-unit increase in BMI above 25, the corresponding increases in risk were 49% for cardiovascular mortality, 38% for respiratory disease mortality, and 19% for cancer mortality. This meta-analysis also excluded participants who were current or former smokers, those who had chronic diseases at the beginning of the study, and any who died in the first five years of follow-up (a combined 1.6 million deaths were recorded across these studies where participants were followed for an average of 14 years).

When examining the relationship between BMI and mortality, failure to adjust for these variables can lead to reverse causation (where a low body weight is the result of underlying illness, rather than the cause) or confounding by smoking (because smokers tend to weigh less than non-smokers and have much higher mortality rates). Experts say these methodological flaws have led to paradoxical, misleading results that suggest a survival advantage to being overweight.
Waist Circumference
Some researchers consider waist circumference to be a better measure of unhealthy body fat than BMI as it addresses visceral abdominal fat, which is associated with metabolic problems, inflammation, and insulin resistance. [3,9] It is a good predictor of disease risk and early mortality, and provides a clearer picture of health, as abdominal fat can increase even if total weight remains the same. An increasing waist size can be an important “warning sign” that prompts a closer look at potentially unhealthy lifestyle habits. In people who do not have overweight, increasing waist size over time may be an even more telling warning sign of increased health risks than BMI alone. [5,10]
The Nurses’ Health Study looked at the relationship between waist size and death from heart disease, cancer, or any cause in middle-aged women. [10] At the start of the study, more than 44,000 healthy volunteers measured their waist and hip sizes. After 16 years, women who reported the highest waist sizes—35 inches or larger—had nearly double the risk of dying from heart disease, compared with women who reported the lowest waist sizes (<28 inches). Women in the group with the largest waists had a similarly high risk of death from cancer or any cause, compared with women with the smallest waists. The risks increased steadily with each additional inch around the waist. Yet even women with a “normal weight” (BMI <25) were at higher risk, if they carried more of that weight around their waist. Normal-weight women with a waist of 35 inches or higher had three times the risk of death from heart disease, compared with normal-weight women whose waists were smaller than 35 inches.
The Shanghai Women’s Health Study found a similar relationship between increasing waist size and risk of death from any cause in normal-weight women. [11]
How to measure and interpret waist size
Wear thin clothing or no clothing. Stand up straight and wrap a flexible measuring tape around your midsection, laying the tape flat so it crosses your navel (belly button). The tape should be snug but not pinched too tightly around the waist. Inhale and exhale regularly, and then read the measurement (in other words, don’t inhale deeply and hold your breath while measuring!). You can repeat the measurement 2-3 times to ensure a consistent reading. According to an expert panel convened by the National Institutes of Health, a waist size larger than 40 inches for men and 35 inches for women increases the chances of developing heart disease, cancer, or other chronic diseases. [12,13]
Waist-to-Hip Ratio
Like the waist circumference, the waist-to-hip ratio (WHR) is used to measure abdominal obesity. It’s calculated by measuring the waist and the hip (at the widest diameter of the buttocks), and then dividing the waist by the hip measurement. It is inexpensive and simple to use, and a good predictor of disease risk and early mortality. Some believe that WHR may be a better indicator of risk than waist circumference alone, as waist size can vary based on body frame size, but a large study found that waist circumference and WHR were equally effective at predicting risk of death from heart disease, cancer, or any cause. [10]
Still, WHR can be more complex to interpret than waist circumference, since a higher WHR reading can be caused by excess abdominal fat and/or decreased lean muscle mass around the hips. The World Health Organization has also found that cut-off points that define health risks may vary by ethnicity. For example, Asians appear to show higher metabolic risk when carrying higher body fat at a lower BMI; therefore the cut-off value for a healthy WHR in Asian women is 0.80 or less, compared with 0.85 or less in Caucasian women. [14]
How to measure and interpret WHR
Stand up straight and follow the directions for measuring waist circumference. Then wrap the tape measure around the widest part of the buttocks. Divide the waist size by the hip size. The WHO defines abdominal obesity in men as a WHR more than 0.90; for women, more than 0.85. [14]
Waist-to-Height Ratio
Waist-to-height ratio (WHtR) is a simple, inexpensive screening tool that measures visceral abdominal fat. It has been supported by research to predict cardiometabolic risk factors such as hypertension, and early death, even when BMI falls within a healthy range. [15,16] When the waist circumference is less than half one’s height, it is considered lower risk.
To determine WHtR, divide waist circumference in inches by height in inches. A measurement of 0.5 or higher is an indicator of health risks related to visceral obesity.
Additional Measures of Body Fat
Although less commonly used, here are some other methods for measuring body fat.
A caliper measures the thickness of a “pinch” of skin and the fat beneath it in specific areas of the body (torso, thighs, front and back of the upper arm, and under the shoulder blade). Equations are used to predict body fat percentage based on these measurements. It is inexpensive and convenient, but accuracy depends on the skill and training of the measurer. At least three measurements are needed from different body parts. The calipers have a limited range and therefore may not accurately measure persons with obesity or those whose skinfold thickness exceeds the width of the caliper.
BIA equipment sends a small, imperceptible, safe electric current through the body, measuring the resistance. The current faces more resistance passing through body fat than it does passing through lean body mass and water. Equations are used to estimate body fat percentage and fat-free mass. [17] The devices are convenient, portable, and relatively inexpensive but the ratio of body water to fat can change during illness, dehydration, or weight loss, decreasing its accuracy. Readings may also not be as accurate in individuals with a BMI of 35 or higher.
Individuals are weighed on dry land and then again while submerged in a water tank. [17] Researchers use formulas to estimate body volume, body density, and body fat percentage. Fat “floats” with more buoyancy (less density) than water, so someone with high body fat will have a lower body density than someone with low body fat and more muscle. In other words, if one’s weight under water is heavier than on land due to more muscle mass and less fat, this indicates a lower body fat percentage (and visa versa). This method is accurate but costly and typically only used in a research setting. It can cause discomfort as individuals must completely submerge under water including the head, and then exhale completely before obtaining the reading.
This method uses a similar principle to underwater weighing but can be done in the air instead of in water. [17] Individuals sit in a small chamber wearing a bathing suit; one commercial example is the “Bod Pod.” The machine estimates body volume based on air pressure differences between the empty chamber and the occupied chamber. It is expensive but accurate, quick, and comfortable for those who prefer not to be submerged in water.
Individuals drink isotope-labeled water and give body fluid samples. Researchers analyze these samples for isotope levels, which are then used to calculate total body water, fat-free body mass, and in turn, body fat mass. [17] It is accurate, not as costly, and can be used in individuals with a BMI of 40 or higher, but accuracy can be decreased by illness, dehydration, or weight loss.
X-ray beams pass through different body tissues at different rates. DEXA uses two low-level X-ray beams to develop estimates of fat-free mass, fat mass, and bone mineral density. [17] DEXA is accurate but uses heavy expensive equipment so is typically only used in research settings. It cannot distinguish between subcutaneous and visceral fat, cannot be used in persons sensitive to radiation (e.g., pregnant women, children), and cannot accommodate persons with a BMI of 35 or higher.
These two imaging techniques are now considered to be the most accurate methods for measuring tissue, organ, and whole-body fat mass as well as lean muscle mass and bone mass. [17] It can measure specific body fat compartments, such as abdominal fat and subcutaneous fat. However, CT and MRI scans are typically used only in research settings because the equipment is extremely expensive and cannot be moved. CT scans cannot be used with pregnant women or children, due to exposure to ionizing radiation, and certain MRI and CT scanners may not be able to accommodate individuals with a BMI of 35 or higher.
Is it healthier to carry excess weight than being too thin?
Some studies suggest that the connection between body mass index and premature death follows a U-shaped curve. This means that weighing too much—or too little—isn’t as healthy as weighing somewhere in the middle. The problem is that most of these studies included smokers and individuals with early, but undetected, chronic and fatal diseases. Cigarette smokers as a group weigh less than nonsmokers, in part because smoking deadens the appetite. Potentially deadly chronic diseases such as cancer, emphysema, kidney failure, and heart failure can cause weight loss even before they cause symptoms and have been diagnosed. So low weights don’t necessarily cause early death. Instead, low weight is often the result of illnesses or habits that may be fatal.
Many epidemiologic studies confirm that increasing weight is associated with increasing disease risk. The American Cancer Society fielded two large long-term Cancer Prevention Studies that  included more than one million adults who were followed for at least 12 years. [18,19] They excluded people who smoked and others who could experience secondary weight loss from an illness such as cancer or cardiovascular disease, or who developed a chronic disease in the first few years of follow-up. Both studies showed a clear pattern of increasing mortality with increasing weight. The data confirmed similar observations from a 27-year follow-up of more than 19,000 middle-aged men in the Harvard Alumni Health Study, [20] a 16-year follow-up of more than 115,000 middle-aged women in the Nurses’ Health Study, [21] a 12-year follow-up of nonsmoking Seventh-day Adventists, [22] and a 10-year follow-up of more than 500,000 middle-aged men and women in the National Institutes of Health/AARP study. [23] Another analysis of the Cancer Prevention Study cohort found that increased weight was tied to increased mortality from all cancers and specific cancers; [24] in fact, study investigators estimated that overweight and obesity is responsible for 14% of all cancer deaths in women and 20% of all cancer deaths in men.
According to the current Dietary Guidelines for Americans a body mass index below 18.5 falls outside the healthy range. But some people live long, healthy lives with a low body mass index. Here’s a good rule of thumb: If you’ve always had a low body mass index and your weight and health condition doesn’t change much, don’t worry. But if you start losing weight without trying, discuss with your doctor the reasons why this could be happening. Learn more aboutmaintaining a healthy weight.

Oral Health
“There is no health without oral health.” You may have heard this statement but what does it mean? The health of our mouth, or oral health, is more important than many of us may realize. It is a key indicator of overall health, which is essential to our well-being and quality of life.
Although preventable to a great extent, untreated tooth decay (or cavities) is the most common health condition worldwide. When we think about the potential consequences of untreated oral diseases including pain, reduced quality of life, lost school days, disruption to family life, and decreased work productivity, making sure our mouths stay healthy is incredibly important. [1]
What is a Healthy Mouth?
The mouth, also called the oral cavity, starts at the lips and ends at the throat. A healthy mouth and well-functioning teeth are important at all stages of life since they support human functions like breathing, speaking, and eating. In a healthy mouth, tissues are moist, odor-free, and pain-free. When we talk about a healthy mouth, we are not just talking about the teeth but also the gingival tissue (or gums) and the supporting bone, known together as the periodontium. The gingiva may vary in color from coral pink to heavily pigmented and vary in pattern and color between different people. Healthy gingiva is firm, not red or swollen, and does not bleed when brushed or flossed. A healthy mouth has no untreated tooth decay and no evidence of lumps, ulcers, or unusual color on or under the tongue, cheeks, or gums. Teeth should not be wiggly but firmly attached to the gingiva and bone. It should not hurt to chew or brush your teeth.
Throughout life, teeth and oral tissues are exposed to many environmental factors that may lead to disease and/or tooth loss. The most common oral diseases are tooth decay and periodontal disease. Good oral hygiene and regular visits to the dentist, combined with a healthy lifestyle and avoiding risks like excess sugar and smoking, help to avoid these two diseases.

Just like a healthy body, a healthy smile depends on good nutrition. Abalanced dietwith adequate nutrients is essential for a healthy mouth and in turn, a healthy mouth supports nutritional well-being. Food choices and eating habits are important in preventing tooth decay and gingival disease.
Minerals likecalciumandphosphoruscontribute to dental health by protecting and rebuilding tooth enamel. [2] Enamel is the hard outer protective layer of the tooth (fun fact: enamel is the hardest substance in the human body). Eating foods high in calcium and other nutrients such ascheese,milk,plain yogurt,calcium-fortified tofu,leafy greens, andalmondsmay help tooth health. [2] Whileprotein-rich foodslike meat, poultry, fish, milk and eggs are great sources of phosphorus.
When it comes to a healthy smile,fruits and vegetablesare also good choices since they are high in water andfiber, which balance the sugars they hold and help to clean the teeth. [2] These foods also help stimulate saliva, which helps to wash away acids and food from teeth, both neutralizing acid and protecting teeth from decay. Many fruits and vegetables also have vitamins likevitamin C, which is important for healthy gingiva and healing, andvitamin A,another key nutrient in building tooth enamel.[2]
Wateris the clear winner as the best drink for your teeth—particularly fluoridated water. It helps keep your mouth clean and helps fight dry mouth.Fluorideis needed regularly throughout life to protect teeth against tooth decay. [3] Drinking water with fluoride is one of the easiest and most beneficial things you can do to help prevent cavities.

Malnutrition and oral health
Nutrition and oral health are closely related. The World Health Organization defines malnutrition as deficiencies, excesses, or imbalances in a person’s intake of energy and/or nutrients. This means that malnutrition can be over-nutrition or undernutrition. Dental pain or missing teeth can lead to difficulty chewing or swallowing food which negatively affects nutrition. This may mean eating fewer meals or meals with lower nutritional value due to impaired oral health and increased risk of malnutrition. On the other hand, lack of proper nutrients can also negatively affect the development of the oral cavity, the progression of oral diseases and result in poor healing. [5] In this way, nutrition affects oral health, and oral health affects nutrition.
Nutrition is a major factor in infection and inflammation. [5] Inflammation is part of the body’s process of fighting against things that harm it, like infections and injuries. Although inflammation is a natural part of the body’s immune response to protect and heal the body, it can be harmful if it becomes unbalanced. In this way inflammation is a dominant factor in many chronic diseases. Periodontal diseases and obesity are risk factors involved in the onset and progression of chronic inflammation and its consequences. [6]
Oral Health and General Health
While it may appear that oral diseases only affect the mouth, their consequences can affect the rest of the body as well. There is a proven relationship between oral and general health. Many health conditions may increase the risk of oral diseases, and poor oral health can negatively affect many general health conditions and the management of those conditions. Most oral diseases share common risk factors with chronic diseases likecardiovascular disease,cancers,diabetes, and respiratory diseases. These risk factors include unhealthy diets, particularly those high in added sugar, as well as tobacco and alcohol use. [7]
Infective endocarditis (IE), an infection of the inner lining of the heart muscle, can be caused by bacteria that live on teeth. [8] Gingivitis and periodontitis are inflammatory diseases of the gingiva and supporting structures of the teeth caused by specific bacteria. There is evidence that the surface of inflamed tissue around teeth is the point of entry for the specific bacteria that cause as much as 50% of the IE cases in the U.S. annually. This means that improving oral hygiene may help in reducing the risk of developing IE. In addition, periodontal disease may be associated withheart diseaseand shares risk factors including tobacco use, poorly controlleddiabetes, andstress. [9,10]
Oral health is an important part of prenatal care. Poor oral health during pregnancy can result in poor health outcomes for both mother and baby. For example, studies suggest that pregnant women who have periodontal disease may be more likely to have a baby that is born too early and too small. [7] Hormonal changes during pregnancy, particularly elevated levels of progesterone, increase susceptibility to periodontal disease, which includes gingivitis and periodontitis. For this reason, your dentist may recommend more frequent professional cleanings during your pregnancy.
If you are struggling with morning sickness, the stomach acid from vomiting can erode or wear away tooth enamel. To help prevent the effects of erosion, rinse your mouth with 1 teaspoon of baking soda mixed in a cup of water, then wait 30 minutes before brushing your teeth. [11]
Conditions that impact oral health
Certain conditions may also affect your oral health, including:
Anxiety and stress.Stressis a normal human reaction that everyone experiences at one point or another. However, stress that is left unchecked can contribute to many health problems including oral health issues. While behavioral changes play a leading role in these poor oral health findings, there are certain physiological effects on the body as well. Stress creates a hormone in the body called cortisol. Spikes in this hormone can weaken theimmune systemand increase susceptibility to developing periodontal disease. Evidence has shown that stress reduces the flow of saliva which in turn can contribute to dental plaque formation. [12] Certain medications like antidepressants and anti-anxiety medications can also cause dry mouth, increasing risk of tooth decay. Additionally, stress may contribute to teeth grinding (or bruxism), clenching, cold sores, and canker sores.
Osteoporosis and Paget’s Disease. Medical conditions such as osteoporosis are a fitting example of why it is so important to let your dentist know about all the medications you are taking. Certain medications like antiresorptive agents, a group of drugs that slows bone loss, can influence dental treatment decisions. That is because these medications have been associated with a rare but serious condition called osteonecrosis of the jaw (ONJ), which can damage the jawbone. Bisphosphonates (Fosamax, Actonel, and Boniva) and Denosumab (or Prolia) are examples of antiresorptive agents. Although it can occur spontaneously, ONJ more commonly occurs following surgical dental procedures like extracting a tooth or implant placement. Be sure to tell your dentist if you are taking antiresorptive agents so they can take that into account when developing your treatment plan.

Eating Concerns: What to Eat If You Have…
Depending on the type of orthodontic treatment, your braces may have brackets, bands, and wires. In this case, it is important to avoid eating hard or sticky food. This includes things like nuts, popcorn, hard candy or gum, which could break or displace parts of your orthodontics and potentially delay your treatment. Enjoying pasta, soft veggies, fruits, and dairy products are good choices. Having good oral hygiene is key in making sure tooth decay do not form around the braces. This means making sure the teeth and braces are thoroughly cleaned of food debris so that plaque does not accumulate. Allowing plaque to build-up can cause white spots on the surfaces of the teeth. You can ask your dentist for tips on how to maintain good oral hygiene.
If you have clear trays or aligners that are removable, you should always remove your trays before eating or drinking any liquid other than water. Regardless of whether food is hard or soft, removing your tray before eating helps to ensure effectiveness of your treatment.
If you wear dentures, adjusting to what and how you eat can be a major challenge. When you first get dentures, your mouth and tissue need time to adjust to chewing and biting. Starting with soft foods like soups, smoothies, and applesauce for your first few meals can help make the transition more comfortable. Be mindful of hot dishes and drinks as it can sometimes be difficult to gauge the temperature of your food. After a couple of days, you can move onto more solid foods as your mouth begins to adjust to the dentures. Take care to avoid hard or sticky food and tough meats which could break or damage your dentures. Denture-friendly foods include slow-cooked or ground meats, cooked fish, ripe fruits, and cooked vegetables. A good tip is that if you can cut the food with a fork, chances are the food will not damage your dentures.
Dry mouth or xerostomia can make it difficult to talk, chew, and swallow food. Symptoms of dry mouth may include increased thirst, sore mouth and tongue, difficulty swallowing and talking, and changes in taste. [14] If you are experiencing a dry mouth, it is important to talk to your oral health care provider (as well as primary care provider) to better understand the potential causes and management. Regardless of the cause, you have lots of options for making it easier to eat. First, ensure that you drink plenty of fluids and sip cold water between meals. Chew your food well if you’re having trouble swallowing and only take small bites. Combining solid foods with liquid foods such as yogurt, gravy, sauces, or milk can also help. You want to avoid foods that are acidic, hot, or spicy as these may irritate your mouth further. Good oral care also plays a key role in alleviating dry mouth and preventing tooth decay, which is a common oral complication of dry mouth.
Oral Health Tips
Here are some actions you can take to support good oral health: [15]
Drink fluoridated water and brush with fluoride toothpaste.
Practice good oral hygiene. Brush teeth thoroughly twice a day and floss daily between the teeth to remove dental plaque.
Visit your dentist at least once a year (the average person should go twice a year), even if you have no natural teeth or have dentures.
Do not use any tobacco products. If you smoke, seek resources to help you quit.
Limit alcoholic drinks. Somealcoholic beveragescan be very acidic, resulting in erosion of tooth enamel, and those with a high alcohol content can lead to dry mouth. Also be mindful of drink mixers, many of which are high in sugar and can increase the risk of tooth decay.
If you havediabetes, work to support control of the disease. This will decrease the risk for other complications, including gum disease. Treating gum disease may help lower your blood sugar level.
If your medication causes dry mouth, discuss other medication options with your doctor that may not cause this condition. If dry mouth cannot be avoided, drink plenty of water, chew sugarless gum, and avoid tobacco products and alcohol. Your oral health care provider may be able to recommend over-the-counter or prescription medications to improve your dry mouth as well.
See your doctor or a dentist if you experience sudden changes in taste and smell.
When acting as a caregiver, help those who are not able to brush and floss their teeth independently.
Chew sugar-free xylitol gum between meals and/or when you are unable to brush after a meal.
Bottom Line – There Is No Health Without Oral Health
As growing research and studies reveal the link between oral health and overall health, it becomes more evident that taking care of your teeth isn’t just about having a nice smile and pleasant breath. Studies show that poor oral health is linked to heart disease, diabetes, pregnancy complications, and more, while positive oral health can enhance both mental and overall health. Good oral hygiene and regular visits to the dentist, combined with a healthy lifestyle and avoiding risks like excess sugar and smoking, help to keep your smile and body healthy.
Oral Cavity (mouth)starts at the lips and ends at the throat including the lips, inside the cheeks and lips, the tongue, gums, under the tongue, and roof of the mouth.
Enamelis the hard calcified tissue covering the surface of the tooth.
Gingiva (gums)is the soft tissue covering the necks of the teeth and the jaw bones.
Periodontiumis a group of specialized tissues that surround and support the teeth, including the gingiva and bone.
Periodontal disease (gum disease)includes gingivitis and periodontitis. Gingivitis is the mildest form, in which the gums become red, swollen, and bleed easily. Gingivitis is reversible with professional treatment and good at-home oral care. If untreated, gingivitis can advance to periodontitis where chronic inflammation causes the tissues and bone that support the teeth to be damaged. Overtime, teeth can become loose and may fall out or need to be removed. [16]

Vitamin A
It’s only a semi-myth that eating carrots will help you see in the dark. A carrot’s main nutrient, beta-carotene (responsible for this root vegetable’s characteristic orange color), is a precursor to vitamin A and helps your eyes to adjust in dim conditions. Vitamin A can’t give you superpowers of night vision or cure your dependence on contact lenses, but eating an adequate amount will support eye health.
Vitamin A also stimulates the production and activity of white blood cells, takes part in remodeling bone, helps maintain healthy endothelial cells (those lining the body’s interior surfaces), and regulates cell growth and division such as needed for reproduction.
The two main forms of vitamin A in the human diet are preformed vitamin A (retinol, retinyl esters), and provitamin A carotenoids such as alpha-carotene and beta-carotene that are converted to retinol. Preformed vitamin A comes from animal products, fortified foods, and vitamin supplements. Carotenoids are found naturally in plant foods. There are other types of carotenoids found in food that are not converted to vitamin A but have health-promoting properties; these include lycopene, lutein, and zeaxanthin.
Recommended Amounts
Vitamin A is currently listed on the Nutrition Facts label measured in international units (IU). However, the Institute of Medicine lists the Recommended Dietary Allowances (RDA) of vitamin A in micrograms (mcg) of retinol activity equivalents (RAE) to account for different absorption rates of preformed vitamin A and provitamin A carotenoids. Under the Food and Drug Administration’s (FDA) new food and dietary supplement labeling regulations, as of July 2018 large companies will no longer list vitamin A as IU but as “mcg RAE.” [1]
RDA:The Recommended Dietary Allowance for adults 19 years and older is 900 mcg RAE for men (equivalent to 3,000 IU) and 700 mcg RAE for women (equivalent to 2,333 IU).
UL:The Tolerable Upper Intake Level is the maximum daily intake unlikely to cause harmful effects on health. The UL for vitamin A from retinol is 3,000 micrograms of preformed vitamin A.
Vitamin A and Health
The evidence suggests that eating a variety of foods rich in vitamin A, especiallyfruits and vegetables, is protective from certain diseases, though the health benefit of vitamin A supplements is less clear.
Lung Cancer:Observational studies following nonsmokers and current or former smokers have found that higher intakes of carotenoids from fruits and vegetables are associated with a lower risk of lung cancer. However, three large clinical trials did not find that supplements of beta-carotene and vitamin A helped to prevent or reduce lung cancer risk. In fact, two of those three trials actually found a significant increase in lung cancer risk among study participants taking supplements with beta-carotene or retinyl palmitate (a form of vitamin A). [1] Therefore, it is recommended that current or former smokers and workers exposed to asbestos do not use high-dose beta-carotene and retinyl palmitate supplements. Additionally, based on current evidence the U.S. Preventive Services Task Force advises against the use of beta-carotene supplements for the prevention of any cancer, stating that there is potentially greater harm in using these supplements than any suggested benefit. [2]
Prostate Cancer:Lycopene is a carotenoid that gives fruits and vegetables a pink or red hue, as in tomatoes and grapefruit. There has been interest in lycopene’s effects on cancer due to its antioxidant properties. Observational studies have noted a decreased risk of prostate cancer in men who eat high amounts of fruits and vegetables. Unfortunately, studies have not provided a clear answer specific to lycopene. Observational studies and clinical trials have shown either a protective effect of lycopene-rich foods (specifically tomatoes) or supplements, or no effect. [3] A Harvard study of more than 51,000 men from the Health Professionals Follow-up Study found a protective effect from advanced stages of prostate cancer in those with higher intakes of tomato sauce. [4] A 2015 meta-analysis of 26 studies found that higher lycopene intakes appeared protective from prostate cancer incidence. [5] However, an FDA review stated that definite conclusions about lycopene could not be made, one reason being that accurate reporting of lycopene intake is difficult due to variations in lycopene content during cooking and storage. [6] Another was that lycopene-rich foods often contain other cancer-protective compounds, so it would be difficult to isolate any health benefits to lycopene
The randomized controlled Mediterranean-DASH Intervention for Neurodegenerative Delay (MIND) trial examines the effects of the MIND diet to prevent cognitive decline. It found that higher blood levels of alpha-carotene (a form of vitamin A that includes lutein and zeaxanthin) were associated with better cognition (e.g., memory, learning, attention) in participants at risk for cognitive decline. [7] Foods contributing to higher alpha-carotene levels included fruits, and green leafy and orange vegetables.
Age-related macular degeneration(AMD) is a common painless eye condition but a leading cause of vision loss among people age 50 and older. It distorts the sharp, central vision needed to see fine details such as for reading and driving. The exact cause is unclear but oxidative stress is believed to play a role. Smokers and those with poor diets lacking fruits and vegetables have a higher risk of developing AMD. Lutein and zeaxanthin are two carotenoids with protective antioxidant effects that are found in the retina, the eye tissue that is damaged by AMD. Studies have looked to see if supplements containing lutein and zeaxanthin, as well as beta-carotene, might be useful for preventing or treating this condition. The NIH-funded Age-Related Eye Disease Studies (AREDS, AREDS2) found that daily intakes of high-dose vitamins including vitamins C and E and lutein and zeaxanthin slowed the progression of intermediate and late-stage AMD, particularly in participants who ate the lowest amounts of carotenoids. [8,9] Beta-carotene was not found to be protective.
Food Sources
Many breakfast cereals, juices, dairy products, and other foods are fortified with retinol (preformed vitamin A). Manyfruits and vegetablesand some supplements contain beta-carotene, lycopene, lutein, or zeaxanthin.

Signs of Deficiency and Toxicity
DeficiencyVitamin A deficiency is rare in Western countries but may occur. Conditions that interfere with normal digestion can lead to vitamin A malabsorption such as celiac disease, Crohn’s disease, cirrhosis, alcoholism, and cystic fibrosis. Also at risk are adults and children who eat a very limited diet due to poverty or self-restriction.  Mild vitamin A deficiency may cause fatigue, susceptibility to infections, and infertility. The following are signs of a more serious deficiency.
Xerophthalmia, a severe dryness of the eye that if untreated can lead to blindness
Nyctalopia or night blindness
Irregular patches on the white of the eyes
Dry skin or hair
ToxicityVitamin A toxicity may be more common in the U.S. than a deficiency, due to high doses of preformed vitamin A (retinol) found in some supplements. Vitamin A is also fat-soluble, meaning that any amount not immediately needed by the body is absorbed and stored in fat tissue or the liver. If too much is stored, it can become toxic. The tolerable upper intake of 3,000 mcg of preformed vitamin A, more than three times the current recommended daily level, is thought to be safe. However, there is some evidence that this much preformed vitamin A might increase the risk of bone loss, hip fracture [10-12], or some birth defects. [13] Another reason to avoid too much preformed vitamin A is that it may interfere with the beneficial actions ofvitamin D. Signs of toxicity include the following.
Vision changes such as blurry sight
Bone pain
Nausea and vomiting
Dry skin
Sensitivity to bright light like sunlight
In contrast to preformed vitamin A, beta-carotene is not toxic even at high levels of intake. The body can form vitamin A from beta-carotene as needed, and there is no need to monitor intake levels as with preformed vitamin A. Therefore, it is preferable to choose a multivitamin supplement that has all or the vast majority of its vitamin A in the form of beta-carotene; many multivitamin manufacturers have already reduced the amount of preformed vitamin A in their products. However, there is no strong reason for most people to take individual high-dose beta-carotene supplements. Smokers in particular should avoid these, since some randomized trials in smokers have linked high-dose supplements with increased lung cancer risk. [14-16]
Did You Know?
Sometimes people take cod liver oil for vitamin D but may not be aware it is also very high in vitamin A, beyond the RDA at 192%, in the same synthetic form as in supplements (retinyl palmitate). So if you use cod liver oil, make sure your other supplements do not contain extra vitamin A. Other forms of fish oil supplements typically do not contain significant amounts of vitamin A, but always check the label.
There have been claims that vitamin A (in the form of retinol or retinyl palmitate) added to some sunscreens, moisturizers, and lip balms can cause vitamin A toxicity or cancer if used excessively. However, there has not been evidence to date to support this. Vitamin A in topical creams is not absorbed into the bloodstream and therefore would not contribute to toxic levels. The concern with cancer stemmed from studies in mice conducted by the FDA. [17] The results showed increased oxidative stress (a potential precursor to cancer) in cancer cells exposed to retinyl palmitate and ultraviolet light. After review of these and other studies, a statement from the American Academy of Dermatology asserted, “Based on the current available data from in vitro, animal and human studies, there is no convincing evidence to support the notion that retinyl palmitate in sunscreens causes cancer.” [18] They cited the high susceptibility of mice to skin cancer after ultraviolet exposure, even in the absence of retinyl palmitate, and therefore the results of these animal studies should not be applied to humans.Retinoids in skin creams can cause skin to become highly sensitive to bright light, so it is advised to apply vitamin A creams at night and to avoid strong sun after their use.

Vitamin E
Vitamin E is a fat-soluble vitamin with several forms, but alpha-tocopherol is the only one used by the human body. Its main role is to act as an antioxidant, scavenging loose electrons—so-called “free radicals”—that can damage cells. [1] It also enhances immune function and prevents clots from forming in heart arteries. Antioxidant vitamins, including vitamin E, came to public attention in the 1980s when scientists began to understand that free radical damage was involved in the early stages of artery-clogging atherosclerosis, and might also contribute to cancer, vision loss, and a host of other chronic conditions. Vitamin E has the ability to protect cells from free radical damage as well as reduce the production of free radicals in certain situations. However, conflicting study results have dimmed some of the promise of using high dose vitamin E to prevent chronic diseases.
Recommended Amounts
The Recommended Dietary Allowance (RDA) for vitamin E for males and females ages 14 years and older is 15 mg daily (or 22 international units, IU), including women who are pregnant. Lactating women need slightly more at 19 mg (28 IU) daily.
Vitamin E and Health
For a time, vitamin E supplements looked like an easy way to prevent cardiovascular disease. The U.S. Preventive Services Task Force’s latest review of evidence from clinical trials found no conclusive benefit of vitamin E supplements for the prevention of cardiovascular disease, and therefore recommended against their use. [2] Although some large observational studies and clinical trials have shown a heart-protective benefit from these supplements, particularly in relatively healthy people, most randomized clinical trials have shown no benefit in either healthy people or those at risk for, or with, heart disease.
Benefit Found
Observational studies:The Nurses’ Health Study [3] and Health Professionals Follow-Up Study [4] suggested 20-40% reductions in heart disease risk among individuals who took vitamin E supplements (usually containing 400 IU or more) for at least two years. [5]
Randomized controlled trials:In the Women’s Health Study, which followed almost 40,000 healthy women for 10 years, vitamin E supplements of 600 IU taken every other day did not significantly reduce the risk of so-called “major cardiac events” (heart attack, stroke, or cardiovascular death). But there was some encouraging news in the findings: When these major cardiac events were analyzed separately, vitamin E supplementation was linked to a 24% lower risk of cardiovascular death. [6] And among women ages 65 and older, vitamin E supplementation reduced the risk of major cardiac events by 26%. A later analysis found that women who took the vitamin E supplements also had a lower risk of developing serious blood clots in the legs and lungs, with women at the highest risk of such blood clots receiving the greatest benefit. [7]
No Benefit Found
Randomized controlled trials in people who were at high risk for or who had heart disease at baseline.In the GISSI Prevention Trial, the results were mixed but mostly showed no preventive effects after more than three years of treatment with vitamin E among 11,000 heart attack survivors. [8] Results from the Heart Outcomes Prevention Evaluation (HOPE) trial also showed no benefit of four years’ worth of vitamin E supplementation in more than 9,500 men and women already diagnosed with heart disease or at high risk for it. [9] In fact, when the HOPE trial was extended for another four years, researchers found that study volunteers who took vitamin E had a higher risk of heart failure. [10]
Based on such studies, the American Heart Association concluded that “the scientific data do not justify the use of antioxidant vitamin supplements (such as vitamin E) for CVD risk reduction.” [11] It is possible that in people who already have heart disease or are at high risk of heart disease, the use of drugs such as aspirin, beta blockers, and ACE inhibitors mask a modest effect of vitamin E, and that vitamin E may have benefits among healthier people.
Randomized controlled trials in people without heart disease at baseline.The SU.VI.MAX randomized controlled trial found that seven years of low-dose vitamin E supplementation (as part of a daily antioxidant pill) reduced the risk of cancer and the risk of dying from any cause in men, but did not show these beneficial effects in women; the supplements did not offer any protection against heart disease in men or women. [12] Discouraging results have also come from the Physicians’ Health Study II, an eight-year randomized controlled trial that involved nearly 15,000 middle-aged men, most of whom were free of heart disease at the start of the study. Researchers found that taking vitamin E supplements of 400 IU every other day, alone or with vitamin C, failed to offer any protection against heart attacks, strokes, or cardiovascular deaths. [13]
More recent evidence introduces a theory that vitamin E supplements may have potential benefits only in certain subgroups of the general population. A trial of high-dose vitamin E in Israel, for example, showed a marked reduction in heart disease among people with type 2 diabetes who had a common genetic predisposition for greater oxidative stress. [14]
Taken as a whole, observational studies have not found that vitamin E in food or supplements offers much protection against cancer in general, or against specific cancers. [15–24] The U.S. Preventive Services Task Force’s latest review of the evidence from clinical trials on the efficacy of vitamin E for cancer also showed no benefit of these supplements on a decreased incidence of or deaths from any cancer. [2] Observational studies and clinical trials have been inconsistent, some suggesting that vitamin E supplements might lower the risk of advanced prostate cancer in smokers and a large randomized trial suggesting that vitamin E increases the risk of prostate cancer. [17,25–27]
Prostate cancer
Investigators had hoped that the Selenium and Vitamin E Cancer Prevention Trial (SELECT) would give more definitive answers on vitamin E and prostate cancer. SELECT’s 18,000 men were assigned to follow one of four pill regimens—vitamin E plus selenium, vitamin E plus a selenium placebo, selenium plus a vitamin E placebo, or a double placebo—and to be tracked for 7 to 12 years. But investigators halted the study halfway through in 2008 when early analyses showed that vitamin E offered no cancer or prostate cancer prevention benefit. [28] Though the trial ended, researchers continued to follow the men who had participated. In 2011, they reported a 17% higher risk of prostate cancer among men assigned to take vitamin E; there was no significant increased risk of prostate cancer among men who took vitamin E and selenium. [29]
Though these results may sound worrisome, two other major trials of vitamin E and prostate cancer had quite different results: The Alpha-Tocopherol Beta Carotene randomized trial, for example, followed nearly 30,000 Finnish male smokers for an average of six years. [25] It found that men assigned to take daily vitamin E supplements had a 32% lower risk of developing prostate cancer—and a 41% lower risk of dying from prostate cancer—than men given a placebo. Vitamin E’s protective effect was strongest for men whose cancers were far enough along that they could be detected by a clinical exam. The large and long-term Physicians’ Health Study II trial, meanwhile, found that vitamin E supplements did not increase or decrease the risk of prostate cancer or any other cancer. [30]
Why were the SELECT findings on vitamin E and prostate cancer so different from those of earlier studies? Previous studies of vitamin E supplements and prostate cancer found the greatest benefit in men who were smokers and who had more advanced cancers. [17,25–27] In the SELECT trial, however, fewer than 10% of the men were smokers and most had early-stage cancer detected through prostate specific antigen (PSA) blood tests. [28,29] Many early-stage, low-grade prostate cancers identified by PSA test would not become advanced cancers. There is also evidence that different processes may be at work in early versus late-stage prostate cancers. A large trial of a drug to prevent prostate cancer found opposite effects when used in early versus advanced prostate cancers. [31]
Bear in mind that most prostate cancer develops slowly, and any study looking at prostate cancer prevention needs to track men for a long time. By stopping the SELECT trial early, there is no way to tell if vitamin E could have helped protect against prostate cancer in some men if they had continued the trial over a longer period of time. Very few cases in the SELECT trial were of advanced prostate cancer, further limiting the interpretation of the findings.
A six-year trial found that vitamin E, in combination with vitamin C, beta carotene, and zinc, offered some protection against the development of advanced age-related macular degeneration (AMD), but not cataracts, in people who were at high risk of the disease. [32,33] On its own, however, vitamin E does not seem to offer much benefit against either AMD or cataracts. [34,35]
Scientists seeking to untangle the causes of Alzheimer’s, Parkinson’s, and other diseases of the brain and nervous system have focused on the role that free radical damage plays in these diseases’ development. [36] But to date, there is little evidence as to whether vitamin E can help protect against these diseases or that it offers any benefit to people who already have these diseases.
Dementia:Some prospective studies suggest that vitamin E supplements, particularly in combination with vitamin C, may be associated with small improvements in cognitive function or lowered risk of Alzheimer’s disease and other forms of dementia, while other studies have failed to find any such benefit. [37–41] A three-year randomized controlled trial in people with mild cognitive impairment—often a precursor to Alzheimer’s disease—found that taking 2,000 IU of vitamin E daily failed to slow the progression to Alzheimer’s disease. [42] Keep in mind, however, that the progression from mild cognitive impairment to Alzheimer’s disease can take many years, and this study was fairly short, so it is probably not the last word on vitamin E and dementia.
Parkinson’s Disease:Some, but not all, prospective studies suggest that getting higher intakes of vitamin E from diet—not from high-dose supplements—is associated with a reduced risk of Parkinson’s disease. [43–45] In people who already have Parkinson’s, high-dose vitamin E supplements do not slow the disease’s progression. [46] Why the difference between vitamin E from foods versus that from supplements? It is possible that foods rich in vitamin E, such as nuts or legumes, contain other nutrients that protect against Parkinson’s disease. More research is needed.
Amyotrophic Lateral Sclerosis (ALS):One large prospective study that followed nearly 1 million people for up to 16 years found that people who regularly took vitamin E supplements had a lower risk of dying from ALS than people who never took vitamin E supplements. [47] More recently, a combined analysis of multiple studies with more than 1 million participants found that the longer people used vitamin E supplements, the lower their risk of ALS. [48] Clinical trials of vitamin E supplements in people who already have ALS have generally failed to show any benefit, however. [49] This may be a situation where vitamin E is beneficial for prevention, rather than treatment, but more research is needed.

Signs of Deficiency
Because vitamin E is found in a variety of foods and supplements, a deficiency in the U.S. is rare. People who have digestive disorders or do not absorb fat properly (e.g., pancreatitis, cystic fibrosis, celiac disease) can develop a vitamin E deficiency. The following are common signs of a deficiency:
Retinopathy (damage to the retina of the eyes that can impair vision)
Peripheral neuropathy (damage to the peripheral nerves, usually in the hands or feet, causing weakness or pain)
Ataxia (loss of control of body movements)
Decreased immune function
Toxicity
There is no evidence of toxic effects from vitamin E found naturally in foods. Most adults who obtain more than the RDA of 22 IU daily are using multivitamins or separate vitamin E supplements that contain anywhere from 400-1000 IU daily. There have not been reports of harmful side effects of supplement use in healthy people. However, there is a risk of excess bleeding, particularly with doses greater than 1000 mg daily or if an individual is also using a blood thinning medication such as warfarin. For this reason, an upper limit for vitamin E has been set for adults 19 years and older of 1000 mg daily (1465 IU) of any form of tocopherol supplement. [1]
Did You Know?
Due to occasional reports of negative health effects of vitamin E supplements, scientists have debated whether these supplements could be harmful and even increase the risk of death.
Researchers have tried to answer this question by combining the results of multiple studies. In one such analysis, the authors gathered and re-analyzed data from 19 clinical trials of vitamin E, including the GISSI and HOPE studies [50]; they found a higher rate of death in trials where patients took more than 400 IU of supplements a day. While this meta-analysis drew headlines when it was released, there are limitations to the conclusions that can be drawn from it. Some of the findings were based on very small studies. In some of these trials, vitamin E was combined with high doses of beta-carotene, which itself has been related to excess mortality.  Furthermore, many of the high-dose vitamin E trials included in the analysis included people who had advanced heart disease or Alzheimer’s disease. Other meta-analyses have come to different conclusions. So it is not clear that these findings would apply to healthy people. The Physicians’ Health Study II, for example, did not find any difference in death rates between the study participants who took vitamin E and those who took a placebo. [13]

B Vitamins
You’re probably familiar with Vitamin B6 and B12, but did you know there are actually eight B vitamins?
B1 (thiamin)
B2 (riboflavin)
B3 (niacin)
B5 (pantothenic acid)
B6 (pyridoxine)
B7 (biotin)
B9 (folate [folic acid])
B12 (cobalamin)
These vitamins help a variety of enzymes do their jobs, ranging from releasing energy from carbohydrates and fat to breaking down amino acids and transporting oxygen and energy-containing nutrients around the body.
Spotlight on Three of the Bs: Folate, Vitamin B6, and Vitamin B12
One of the advances that changed the way we look at vitamins was the discovery that too little folate is linked to birth defects such as spina bifida and anencephaly.
Folate (Folic Acid) – Vitamin B9
Another line of research about folate and two other B vitamins, vitamin B6 and vitamin B12, explores their roles in reducing some types of cancer and heart disease.

Sugary Drinks
Sugary drinks (also categorized as sugar-sweetened beverages or “soft” drinks) refer to any beverage with added sugar or other sweeteners (high fructose corn syrup, sucrose, fruit juice concentrates, and more). This includes soda, pop, cola, tonic, fruit punch, lemonade (and other “ades”), sweetened powdered drinks, as well as sports and energy drinks.
As a category, these beverages are the single largest source of calories and added sugar in the U.S. diet. [1,2] In other parts of the world, particularly developing countries, sugary drink consumption is rising dramatically due to widespread urbanization and beverage marketing. [3]
How sweet is it?
Aside from soda,energy drinkshave as much sugar as soft drinks, enough caffeine to raise your blood pressure, and additives whose long-term health effects are unknown. For these reasons, it’s best to skip energy drinks. The guide includessports beveragesas well. Although designed to give athletes carbohydrates, electrolytes, and fluid during high-intensity workouts that last one hour or more, for everyone else they’re just another source of calories and sugar.
Drinks naturally high in sugar like 100% fruit juices are also featured. While juice often contains healthful nutrients like vitamins, minerals, and phytochemicals, it should also be limited as it contains just as much sugar (though from naturally occurring fruit sugars) and calories as soft drinks.
Sugary drinks and health
When it comes toranking beverages best for our health, sugary drinks fall at the bottom of the list because they provide so many calories and virtually no other nutrients. People who drink sugary beverages do not feel as full as if they had eaten the same calories from solid food, and research indicates they also don’t compensate for the high caloric content of these beverages by eating less food. [4] The average can of sugar-sweetened soda or fruit punch provides about 150 calories, almost all of them from added sugar. If you were to drink just one of these sugary drinks every day, and not cut back on calories elsewhere, you could gain up to 5 pounds in a year. Beyond weight gain, routinely drinking these sugar-loaded beverages can increase the risk of type 2 diabetes, heart disease, and other chronic diseases. Furthermore, higher consumption of sugary beverages has been linked with an increased risk of premature death. [5]
The more ounces of sugary beverages a person has each day, the more calories he or she takes in later in the day. This is the opposite of what happens with solid food, as people tend to compensate for a large meal by taking in fewer calories at a later meal. This compensatory effect doesn’t seem to be present after consuming soft drinks, for several possible reasons:
Fluids don’t provide the same feeling of fullness or satisfaction as solid foods, as the body doesn’t “register” liquid calories as it does calories from solid food. This may prompt a person to keep eating even after intake of a high-calorie drink.
It is possible that sweet-tasting soft drinks—regardless of whether they are sweetened with sugar or acalorie-free sugar substitute—might stimulate the appetite for other sweet, high-carbohydrate foods.
Even though soda may contain more sugar than a cookie, because people think of soda as a drink and a cookie as a dessert they are more likely to limit food than beverages.
Dozens of studies have explored possible links between soft drinks and weight, and they consistently show that increased consumption of soft drinks is associated with increased energy (caloric) intake.
One meta-analysis of 88 studies showed that the effect appeared to be stronger in women. [6]
Studies in children and adults have found that reducing sugary drink consumption can lead to better weight control among those who are initially overweight. [7,8]
An 18-month trial involving 641 primarily normal-weight children randomly assigned to receive either a sugar-free, artificially sweetened beverage (sugar-free group) or a similar sugar-containing beverage (sugar group) found that replacement of sugar-containing beverages with noncaloric beverages reduced weight gain and fat accumulation in the normal-weight children. [9]
Other studies have found a significant link between sugary drink consumption and weight gain in children. [10] One study found that for each additional 12-ounce soda children consumed each day, the odds of having obesity increased by 60% during 1½ years of follow-up. [11]
A 20-year study on 120,000 men and women found that people who increased their sugary drink consumption by one 12-ounce serving per day gained more weight over time—on average, an extra pound every 4 years—than people who did not change their intake. [12]
An updated meta-analysis looking at the association of sugar-sweetened beverages (SSBs) and weight trends in adults and children was published as a follow-up to a 2013 meta-analysis from the same authors. [13] This review of 85 prospective cohort studies and randomized controlled trials published from 2013 to 2022 included more than 500,000 participants, and again confirmed a strong connection between higher intakes of SSBs and weight gain in both age groups. [14] They also found that a reduced intake of SSBs resulted in weight loss.
Agroundbreaking studyof 33,097 individuals showed that among people with a genetic predisposition for obesity, those who drank sugary drinks were more likely to have obesity than those who did not. [15] This study is important because it suggests that genetic risk for obesity does not need to become a reality if healthy habits, like avoiding sugary drinks, are followed. On the other hand, genetic obesity risk seems to be amplified by consuming sugary drinks.Read an interview with the study’s lead researcher.
Alternatively, drinking water in place of sugary drinks or fruit juices is associated with lower long-term weight gain. [16]
People who consume sugary drinks regularly—1 to 2 cans a day or more—have a 26% greater risk of developingtype 2 diabetesthan people who rarely have such drinks. [17] Risks are even greater in young adults andAsians.
Strong evidence indicates that sugar-sweetened soft drinks contribute to the development of diabetes.
The Nurses’ Health Study explored this connection by following the health of more than 90,000 women for eight years. The nurses who said they had one or more servings a day of a sugar-sweetened soft drink or fruit punch were twice as likely to have developed type 2 diabetes during the study than those who rarely had these beverages. [18]
A similar increase in risk of diabetes with increasing soft drink and fruit drink consumption was seen recently in the Black Women’s Health Study, an ongoing long-term study of nearly 60,000 African-American women from all parts of the United States. [19] Interestingly, the increased risk with soft drinks was tightly linked to increased weight.
In the Framingham Heart Study, men and women who had one or more soft drinks a day were 25 percent more likely to have developed trouble managing blood sugar and nearly 50 percent more likely to have developed metabolic syndrome. [20]
A 2019 study looking at 22–26 years’ worth of data from more than 192,000 men and women participating in three long-term studies (the Nurses’ Health Study, the Nurses’ Health Study II, and the Health Professionals’ Follow-up Study) found that increasing total sugary beverage intake—including both sugar sweetened beverages and 100% fruit juice—by more than 4 ounces per day over a four-year period was associated with a 16% higher risk of type 2 diabetes in the following four years. [21]Increasing consumption ofartificially sweetened beveragesby more than 4 ounces per day over four years was linked with 18% higher diabetes risk, but the authors note these findings should be interpreted with caution due to the possibility of reverse causation (individuals already at high risk for diabetes may switch from sugary beverages to diet drinks) and surveillance bias (high-risk individuals are more likely to be screened for diabetes and thus diagnosed more rapidly).The study also found that drinking more artificially sweetened beverages in place of sugary beverages did not appear to lessen diabetes risk. However, replacing one daily serving of a sugary beverage withwater,coffee, orteawas linked with a 2–10% lower risk of diabetes.

A study that followed 40,000 men for two decades found that those who averaged one can of a sugary beverage per day had a 20% higher risk of having a heart attack or dying from a heart attack than men who rarely consumed sugary drinks. [22]
A related study in women found a similar sugary beverage–heart disease link. The Nurses’ Health Study, which tracked the health of nearly 90,000 women over two decades, found that women who drank more than two servings of sugary beverage each day had a 40 percent higher risk of heart attacks or death from heart disease than women who rarely drank sugary beverages. [23]People who drink a lot of sugary drinks often tend to weigh more—and eat less healthfully—than people who don’t drink sugary drinks, and the volunteers in the Nurses’ Health Study were no exception. But researchers accounted for differences in diet quality, energy intake, and weight among the study volunteers. They found that having an otherwise healthy diet, or being at a healthy weight, only slightly diminished the risk associated with drinking sugary beverages.This suggests that weighing too much, or simply eating too many calories, may only partly explain the relationship between sugary drinks and heart disease. Some risk may also be attributed to the metabolic effects of fructose from the sugar or HFCS used to sweeten these beverages.The adverse effects of the high glycemic load from these beverages on blood glucose, cholesterol fractions, and inflammatory factors probably also contribute to the higher risk of heart disease.  Read more aboutblood sugar and glycemic load.

A 22-year-long study of 80,000 women found that those who consumed a can a day of sugary drink had a 75% higher risk of gout than women who rarely had such drinks. [24] Researchers found a similarly-elevated risk in men. [25]
Soda may pose a unique challenge to healthy bones:
Soda contains high levels of phosphate.
Consuming more phosphate than calcium can have a deleterious effect on bone health. [26]
Getting enoughcalciumis extremely important during childhood and adolescence, when bones are being built.
Soft drinks are generally devoid of calcium and other healthful nutrients, yet they are actively marketed to young age groups.
Milk is a good source of calcium and protein, and also provides vitamin D, vitamin B6, vitamin B12, and other micronutrients.There is an inverse pattern between soft drink consumption and milk consumption – when one goes up, the other goes down. [6]

Results from a Women’s Health Initiative study following 98,786 postmenopausal women (ages aged 50 to 79) for about 20 years found that participants who drank the highest amounts of sugar-sweetened beverages (SSB) had an increased risk of liver cancer. More specifically, those drinking 1 or more servings of SSB daily had an 85% higher risk of liver cancer than those who drank 3 or fewer servings of SSB per month. The participants used questionnaires to self-report their intakes of SSB (including soda and fruit drinks but not fruit juice) and diagnosis of liver cancer. The researchers also examined intakes of artificially sweetened beverages, comparing higher intakes of 1 or more servings per day with lower intakes of 3 or fewer servings per month, but did not find any association with liver cancer. [27]
According to alarge, long-term studyof 37,716 men and 80,647 women in the U.S., the more sugary beverages people drink, the greater their risk of premature death — particularly from cardiovascular disease, and to a lesser extent from cancer. [5]
After adjusting for major diet and lifestyle factors, the researchers found that the more sugary beverages a person drank, the more their risk of early death from any cause increased. Compared with drinking sugary beverages less than once per month, drinking one to four per month was linked with a 1% increased risk; two to six per week with a 6% increase; one to two per day with a 14% increase; and two or more per day with a 21% increase. The increased early death risk linked with sugary drink consumption was more apparent among women than among men.
There was a particularly strong link between drinking sugary beverages and increased risk of early death from cardiovascular disease. Compared with infrequent drinkers, those who drank two or more servings per day had a 31% higher risk of early death from cardiovascular disease. Each additional serving per day of sugary drink was linked with a 10% increased higher risk of cardiovascular disease-related death.
Among both men and women, there was a modest link between consumption and early death risk from cancer.
The study also found that drinking one artificially sweetened beverage per day instead of a sugary one lowered the risk of premature death. However, drinking four or more artificially sweetened beverages per day was associated with increased risk of mortality in women, so researchers cautioned against excessive consumption ofartificially-sweetened beverages.
Another long-term study of 18 years from the Nurses’ Health Study and Health Professionals Follow-up Study also found that sugary beverages were linked with a higher risk of premature death in more than 15,000 men and women with type 2 diabetes. [28] It found an increased risk of early death from any cause as well as a higher incidence of cardiovascular disease (CVD) and premature deaths from CVD. Replacing sugary beverages with artificially sweetened beverages was associated with a significantly lower risk of CVD incidence and early death in adults with diabetes, even after controlling for weight changes.
Results from a Women’s Health Initiative study following 98,786 postmenopausal women (aged 50 to 79) for about 20 years found that participants who drank the highest amounts of sugar-sweetened beverages (SSB) had an increased risk of death from chronic liver diseases like nonalcoholic fatty liver disease, cirrhosis, chronic hepatitis, and fibrosis. [27] More specifically, those drinking 1 or more servings of SSB daily had a 68% higher risk of death from chronic liver disease than those who drank 3 or fewer servings of SSB a month. The participants used questionnaires to self-report their intakes of SSB (including soda and fruit drinks but not fruit juice) and diagnosis of chronic liver disease. The researchers also examined intakes of artificially sweetened beverages, comparing higher intakes of 1 or more servings per day with lower intakes of 3 or fewer servings per month, but did not find any association with deaths from chronic liver disease.
Sugary drink supersizing and the obesity epidemic
There is sufficient scientific evidence that decreasing sugar-sweetened beverage consumption will reduce the prevalence of obesity and obesity-related diseases. [29] Unfortunately, sugary beverages are a regular drink of choice for millions around the world, and a major contributor to the obesity epidemic.
Compounding the problem is that sugary drink portion sizes have risen dramatically over the past 40 years, leading to increased consumption among children and adults:
Before the 1950s, standard soft-drink bottles were 6.5 ounces. In the 1950s, soft-drink makers introduced larger sizes, including the 12-ounce can, which became widely available in 1960. [30] By the early 1990s, 20-ounce plastic bottles became the norm. [31] Today, contour-shaped plastic bottles are available in even larger sizes, such as 1-liter.
In the 1970s, sugary drinks made up about 4% of U.S. daily calorie intake; by 2001, that had risen to about 9%. [32]
Children and youth in the US averaged 224 calories per day from sugary beverages in 1999 to 2004—nearly 11% of their daily calorie intake. [33] From 1989 to 2008, calories from sugary beverages increased by 60% in children ages 6 to 11, from 130 to 209 calories per day, and the percentage of children consuming them rose from 79% to 91%. [34] In 2005, sugary drinks (soda, energy, sports drinks) were the top calorie source in teens’ diets (226 calories per day), beating out pizza (213 calories per day). [2]
Although consumption of sugary drinks in the U.S. has decreased in the past decade, [35] half of the population consumes sugary drinks on a given day; 1 in 4 people get at least 200 calories from such drinks; and 5% get at least 567 calories—equivalent to four cans of soda. [36] These intake levels exceed dietary recommendations for consuming no more than 10% of total daily calories from added sugar [37]
Globally, and in developing countries in particular, sugary drink consumption is rising dramatically due to widespread urbanization and beverage marketing. [3]
The role of sugary drink marketing
Beverage companies spend billions of dollars marketing sugary drinks, yet generally rebuffs suggestions that its products and marketing tactics play any role in the obesity epidemic. [38]
In 2013, Coca-Cola launched an “anti-obesity” advertisement recognizing that sweetened soda and many other foods and drinks have contributed to the obesity epidemic. The company advertised its wide array of calorie-free beverages and encouraged individuals to take responsibility for their own drink choices and weight. Responses to the advertisement were mixed, with many experts calling it misleading and inaccurate in stating the health dangers of soda.
Adding to the confusion, studies funded by the beverage industry are four to eight times more likely to show a finding favorable to industry than independently-funded studies. [39]
It’s also important to note that a significant portion of sugary drink marketing is typically aimed directly at children and adolescents. [40]
A2019 analysis by the UConn Rudd Center for Food Policy and Obesityfound that kids ages 2-11 saw twice as many ads for sugary drinks than for other beverages, and they also saw four times as many ads for certain drinks than adults did. [41] Researchers also analyzed nearly 70 “children’s drinks” (those marketed to parents and/or directly to children), and found that sweetened drinks contributed 62% of children’s drink sales in 2018, including $1.2 billion in fruit drinks (90% of children’s sweetened drink sales) and $146 million in flavored, sweetened water sales.
Cutting back on sugary drinks
When it comes to our health, it’s clear that sugary drinks should be avoided. There is a range of healthier beverages that can be consumed in their place, with water being the top option.
Of course, if you’re a frequent soda drinker, this is easier said than done. If it’s the carbonation you like, give sparkling water a try. If the taste is too bland, try a naturally flavored sparkling water. If that’s still too much of a jump, add a splash of juice, sliced citrus, or even some fresh herbs. You can do this with home-brewed tea as well, like thissparkling iced tea with lemon, cucumber, and mint.
What about “diet” sodas or other drinks with low-calorie sweeteners?
Action beyond the individual level
Reducing our preference for sweet beverages will require concerted action on several levels—from creative food scientists and marketers in the beverage industry, as well as from individual consumers and families, schools and worksites, and state and federal government. We must work together toward this worthy and urgent cause: alleviating the cost and the burden of chronic diseases associated with the obesity and diabetes epidemics in the U.S. and around the world. Fortunately,sugary drinks are a growing topicin policy discussions both nationally and internationally. Learn more about howdifferent stakeholders can take action against sugary drinks.

Healthy kids ‘sweet enough’ without added sugars
The American Heart Association recommends children and teens consume less than 25 grams, or 6 teaspoons, of added sugar per day.
Consuming foods and beverages high in added sugars during childhood is linked to the development of risk factors forheart disease, including an increased risk of obesity and elevated blood pressure.
In a scientific statement published inCirculation, the American Heart Association (AHA) recommends that children ages two to 18 should limit their added sugar consumption to less than six teaspoons (25 grams) per day, and sugary beverages should be limited to no more than eight ounces per week. [1]Sugary drinksare a major contributor to the obesity epidemic, and a 20-ounce bottle of soda alone can include upwards of 16 teaspoons of added sugar. According to the AHA statement, children under the age of two should not consume any foods or beverages with added sugars.
“There is clear evidence that added sugars, especially sugary beverages, contribute to obesity and other metabolic problems,” says Dr. Frank Hu, Professor of Nutrition and Epidemiology at the Harvard Chan School of Public Health. “The AHA’s recommendation to limit added sugar intake for children is an important strategy to improve children’s diet and overall health. Schools, parents, health professionals, and policy makers should work together to help children develop healthier eating and drinking habits at early age.”
The recommendations are based on a review of available evidence examining the cardiovascular health impacts of added sugars on children, including effects on blood pressure, lipids, insulin resistance and diabetes, nonalcoholic fatty liver disease, and obesity. Associations between added sugars and increased heart disease risk factors among US youth were found to be present at levels far below current consumption. The AHA haspreviously recommended limitsof six and nine teaspoons of added sugar per day for women and men, respectively.
Added sugars refer to any sugar—including table sugar, fructose, honey, and agave—consumed on its own, added to foods at home, or used in processing or preparing foods and drinks. The association’s recommendation for children comes ahead of the rollout of theupdated Nutrition Facts Panel, which will differentiate between “added sugars” and naturally occurring sugars.
A good strategy for limiting added sugar is a diet rich in minimally-processed foods, including plenty of fruits and vegetables, whole grains, healthy proteins, and healthy fats, and choosing water over sugary drinks and juices. Use theHarvard Healthy Eating Plateas a guide, and spark a discussion with your child using theKid’s Healthy Eating Plate.

Navigating infant formula shortages
Infant formula shortages in the U.S. have occurred in the past two years largely due to widespread pandemic-related supply-chain problems. A national shortage of infant formula is undoubtedly alarming for families since infants require formula when human milk is not accessible or not available in adequate amounts. Although breastfeeding is encouraged, it is not always a feasible option for mothers who return to work early or do not have access to a lactation support system. Human milk and breastfeeding may also not be possible in infants who have allergies or metabolic or gastrointestinal disorders that require special infant formulas, or who have disabilities that limit breastfeeding.
What you can do now:
Consult first with your child’s pediatrician, especially if your child has allergies or special formula needs. They can inform you of safe alternative brands.
Be flexible in trying different brands, including generic. Many brands advertise special health benefits that have more to do with marketing than an actual difference in their nutrition content.
The Special Supplemental Nutrition Program for Women, Infants, and Children (WIC) offers guidelines foralternatives to brand name infant formulasand forspecial sensitivitiesin the event of a shortage.
If your child is older than 6 months, encourage a mixture of both infant food and formula. If they are closer to one year of age, they may be able to use toddler formula if approved by your pediatrician. After one year of age, babies no longer need formula and can be weaned off.
What not to do:
Avoid hoarding commercial infant formulas, which only prolongs a shortage. The American Academy of Pediatrics advises buying no more than a 10-day to 2-week supply of formula. [1] In addition to regular supermarkets, check drugstores, smaller store chains, and reputable online sites.
Do not make homemade infant formulas. The U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) warns that they carry a risk of bacterial contamination and may not provide appropriate amounts of nutrients and fluids required for an infant’s growth. [2] Infants have been hospitalized or even died due to use of homemade infant formula recipes lacking nutrients.
Do not add extra water to formula to extend its use. This will dilute the nutritional content of the formula and increase the risk for deficiencies.
Avoid infant formulas from other countries unless they are approved by the FDA. FDA approvals are expected soon for formulas manufactured in Europe, for instance, so contact your health care provider (pediatrician, registered dietitian) with specific questions.
Future Directions
Policy changes are needed to prevent a recurrence of severe formula shortages in the future. Anarticle from theAmerican Journal of Clinical Nutritionoutlines the following action steps: [3]
Completion and release of all investigative documents about formula recalls and public hearings to communicate the findings.
The FDA and U.S. Department of Agriculture should create specific rules for formulas that are identified as critical for specialized use to be produced at multiple sites and preferably by multiple companies (as opposed to the current situation of specialized formulas that are produced by a small handful of companies).
Establishment of a national plan related to assessment of formula needs and response to shortages, including those caused by natural disasters or recalls, especially in rural communities and for specialized and medical formulas. This should include considering the use of formulas made by reliable international manufacturers.
Creation of a database of “similar” formulas (e.g., amino acid-based or partial hydrolysate formulas) easily accessible to both consumers and health care providers, so that families can easily identify similar products if their usual formula is out of stock.
Changing of WIC rules to increase flexibility for families to purchase formula alternatives when a shortage occurs, with re-evaluation of the WIC state contracting processes.
Strong advocacy for workplace and postpartum rules to enhance breastfeeding and increase time for breastfeeding at work and before return to work.
A national policy allowing reimbursement for donor breast milk for families, especially when it is medically indicated or when formulas are in short supply.

Coffee
Coffee lovers around the world who reach for their favorite morning brew probably aren’t thinking about its health benefits or risks. And yet this beverage has been subject to a long history of debate. In 1991 coffee was included in a list of possible carcinogens by the World Health Organization. By 2016 it was exonerated, as research found that the beverage was not associated with an increased risk of cancer; on the contrary, there was a decreased risk of certain cancers among those who drink coffee regularly once smoking history was properly accounted for. Additional accumulating research suggests that when consumed in moderation, coffee can be considered ahealthy beverage. Why then in 2018 did one U.S. state pass legislation that coffee must bear a cancer warning label? Read on to explore the complexities of coffee.
Source Of
Caffeine
Vitamin B2 (riboflavin)
Magnesium
Plant chemicals: polyphenols including chlorogenic acid and quinic acid, and diterpenes including cafestol and kahweol
One 8-ounce cup of brewed coffee contains about 95 mg of caffeine. A moderate amount of coffee is generally defined as 3-5 cups a day, or on average 400 mg of caffeine, according to the Dietary Guidelines for Americans.
Coffee and Health
Coffee is an intricate mixture of more than a thousand chemicals. [1] The cup of coffee you order from a coffee shop is likely different from the coffee you brew at home. What defines a cup is the type of coffee bean used, how it is roasted, the amount of grind, and how it is brewed. Human response to coffee orcaffeinecan also vary substantially across individuals. Low to moderate doses of caffeine (50–300 mg) may cause increased alertness, energy, and ability to concentrate, while higher doses may have negative effects such as anxiety, restlessness, insomnia, and increased heart rate. [2] Still, the cumulative research on coffee points in the direction of a health benefit. [3,4] Does the benefit stem from the caffeine or plant compounds in the coffee bean? Is there a certain amount of coffee needed a day to produce a health benefit?
Coffee may affect how cancer develops, ranging from the initiation of a cancer cell to its death. For example, coffee may stimulate the production of bile acids and speed digestion through the colon, which can lower the amount of carcinogens to which colon tissue is exposed. Various polyphenols in coffee have been shown to prevent cancer cell growth in animal studies. Coffee has also been associated with decreased estrogen levels, a hormone linked to several types of cancer. [5] Caffeine itself may interfere with the growth and spread of cancer cells. [6] Coffee also appears to lower inflammation, a risk factor for many cancers.
The 2018 uproar in California due towarning labels placed on coffee productsstemmed from a chemical in the beverage called acrylamide, which is formed when the beans are roasted. Acrylamide is also found in some starchy foods that are processed with high heat like French fries, cookies, crackers, and potato chips. It was classified in the National Toxicology Program’s 2014Report on Carcinogens, as “reasonably anticipated to be a human carcinogen” based on studies in lab animals. However, there is not yet evidence of a health effect in humans from eating acrylamide in food. Regardless, in March 2018 a California judge ruled that all California coffee sellers must warn consumers about the “potential cancer risk” from drinking coffee, because coffee-selling companies failed to show that acrylamide didnotpose a significant health risk. California’s law Proposition 65, or The Safe Drinking Water and Toxic Enforcement Act of 1986, fueled the ruling, which requires a warning label to be placed on any ingredient from a list of 900 confirmed or suspected carcinogens.
However, manycancer experts disputed the ruling, stating that the metabolism of acrylamide differs considerably in animals and humans, and the high amount of acrylamide used in animal research is not comparable to the amount present in food. They cited the beneficial health effects of coffee, with improved antioxidant responses and reduced inflammation, both factors important in cancer prevention. Evidence from the American Institute for Cancer Research concludes that drinking coffee mayreduce risk for endometrial and liver cancer, and based on a systematic review of a large body of research, it is not a risk for the cancers that were studied.
In June 2018, the California Office of Environmental Health Hazard Assessment (OEHHA) proposed anew regulationexempting coffee from displaying cancer warnings under Proposition 65. This proposal was based on a review of more than 1,000 studies published by the World Health Organization’s International Agency for Research on Cancer that found inadequate evidence that drinking coffee causes cancer. In January 2019, OEHHA completed its review and response to comments and submitted the regulation to the Office of Administrative Law (OAL) for final review.
Although ingestion of caffeine can increase blood sugar in the short-term, long-term studies have shown that habitual coffee drinkers have a lower risk of developingtype 2 diabetescompared with non-drinkers. The polyphenols and minerals such as magnesium in coffee may improve the effectiveness of insulin and glucose metabolism in the body.
In a meta-analysis of 45,335 people with type 2 diabetes followed for up to 20 years, an association was found with increasing cups of coffee and a lower risk of developing diabetes. Compared with no coffee, the decreased risk ranged from 8% with 1 cup a day to 33% for 6 cups a day. Caffeinated coffee showed a slightly greater benefit than decaffeinated coffee. [7]
Another meta-analysis of prospective cohort studies showed similar associations. When comparing the highest intake of coffee (up to 10 cups a day) with the lowest (<1 cup), there was a 30% decreased risk of type 2 diabetes in those drinking the highest amounts of coffee and caffeine and a 20% decreased risk when drinking decaffeinated coffee. Further analysis showed that the incidence of diabetes decreased by 12% for every 2 extra cups of coffee a day, and 14% for every 200 mg a day increase in caffeine intake (up to 700 mg a day). [8]
Caffeine is a stimulant affecting the central nervous system that can cause different reactions in people. In sensitive individuals, it can irritate the stomach, increase anxiety or a jittery feeling, and disrupt sleep. Although many people appreciate the temporary energy boost after drinking an extra cup of coffee, high amounts of caffeine can cause unwanted heart palpitations in some.
Unfiltered coffee, such as French press and Turkish coffees, contains diterpenes, substances that can raise bad LDL cholesterol and triglycerides. Espresso coffee contains moderate amounts of diterpenes. Filtered coffee (drip-brewed coffee) and instant coffee contain almost no diterpenes as the filtering and processing of these coffee types removes the diterpenes.
Despite these factors, evidence suggests that drinking coffee regularly may lower the risk ofheart disease and stroke:
Among 83,076 women in the Nurses’ Health Study, drinking 4 or more cups of coffee each day was associated with a 20% lower risk of stroke compared with non-drinkers. Decaffeinated coffee also showed an association, with 2 or more cups daily and a 11% lower stroke risk. The authors found no such association with other caffeinated drinks such as tea and soda. These coffee-specific results suggest that components in coffee other than caffeine may be protective. [9]
A large cohort of 37,514 women concluded that moderate coffee drinking of 2-3 cups a day was associated with a 21% reduced risk of heart disease. [10]
In addition, a meta-analysis of 21 prospective studies of men and women looking at coffee consumption and death from chronic diseases found a link between moderate coffee consumption (3 cups per day) and a 21% lower risk of cardiovascular disease deaths compared with non-drinkers. [11]
Another meta-analysis of 36 studies including men and women reviewed coffee consumption and risk of cardiovascular diseases (including heart disease, stroke, heart failure, and deaths from these conditions). It found that when compared with the lowest intakes of coffee (average 0 cups), a moderate coffee intake of 3-5 cups a day was linked with a 15% lower risk of cardiovascular disease. Heavier coffee intake of 6 or more cups daily was neither associated with a higher nor a lower risk of cardiovascular disease. [12]
Naturally occurring polyphenols in both caffeinated and decaffeinated coffee can act as antioxidants to reduce damaging oxidative stress and inflammation of cells. It may have neurological benefits in some people and act as an antidepressant. [13] Caffeine may affect mental states such as increasing alertness and attention, reducing anxiety, and improving mood. [14] A moderate caffeine intake of less than 6 cups of coffee per day has been associated with a lower risk of depression and suicide. However in a few cases of sensitive individuals, higher amounts of caffeine may increase anxiety, restlessness, and insomnia. Suddenly stopping caffeine intake can cause headache, fatigue, anxiety, and low mood for a few days and may persist for up to a week. [15]
A prospective cohort study following 263,923 participants from the National Institutes of Health and American Association of Retired Persons found that those who drank 4 or more cups of coffee a day were almost 10% less likely to become depressed than those who drank none. [15]
In a meta-analysis of observational studies including 330,677 participants, the authors found a 24% reduced risk of depression when comparing the highest (4.5 cups/day) to lowest (<1 cup) intakes of coffee. They found an 8% decreased risk of depression with each additional cup of coffee consumed. There was also a 28% reduced risk of depression comparing the highest to lowest intakes of caffeine, with the greatest benefit occurring with caffeine intakes between 68 and 509 mg a day (about 6 oz. to 2 cups of coffee). [16]
A review looking at three large prospective cohorts of men and women in the U.S. found a decreasing risk of suicide with increasing coffee consumption. When compared with no-coffee drinkers, the pooled risk of suicide was 45% lower among those who drank 2-3 cups daily and 53% lower among those who drank 4 or more cups daily. There was no association between decaffeinated coffee and suicide risk, suggesting that caffeine was the key factor, rather than plant compounds in coffee. [17]
Parkinson’s disease(PD) is mainly caused by low dopamine levels. There is consistent evidence from epidemiologic studies that higher consumption of caffeine is associated with lower risk of developing PD. The caffeine in coffee has been found in animal and cell studies to protect cells in the brain that produce dopamine.A systematic review of 26 studies including cohort and case-control studies found a 25% lower risk of developing PD with higher intakes of caffeinated coffee. It also found a 24% decreased risk with every 300 mg increase in caffeine intake. [18]A Finnish cohort study tracked coffee consumption and PD development in 6,710 men and women over 22 years. In that time, after adjusting for known risks of PD, those who drank at least 10 cups of coffee a day had a significantly lower risk of developing the disease than non-drinkers. [19]A large cohort of men and women were followed for 10 and 16 years, respectively, to study caffeine and coffee intake on PD. The results showed an association in men drinking the most caffeine (6 or more cups of coffee daily) and a 58% lower risk of PD compared with men drinking no coffee. Women showed the lowest risk when drinking moderate intakes of 1-3 cups coffee daily. [20]
A systematic review of 26 studies including cohort and case-control studies found a 25% lower risk of developing PD with higher intakes of caffeinated coffee. It also found a 24% decreased risk with every 300 mg increase in caffeine intake. [18]
A Finnish cohort study tracked coffee consumption and PD development in 6,710 men and women over 22 years. In that time, after adjusting for known risks of PD, those who drank at least 10 cups of coffee a day had a significantly lower risk of developing the disease than non-drinkers. [19]
A large cohort of men and women were followed for 10 and 16 years, respectively, to study caffeine and coffee intake on PD. The results showed an association in men drinking the most caffeine (6 or more cups of coffee daily) and a 58% lower risk of PD compared with men drinking no coffee. Women showed the lowest risk when drinking moderate intakes of 1-3 cups coffee daily. [20]
Alzheimer’s disease:In the CAIDE (Cardiovascular Risk Factors, Aging and Dementia) study, drinking 3-5 cups of coffee a day at midlife (mean age 50 years) was associated with a significantly decreased risk of Alzheimer’s disease later in life compared with low coffee drinkers after 21 years of follow-up. [2]However, three systematic reviews were inconclusive about coffee’s effect on Alzheimer’s disease due to a limited number of studies and a high variation in study types that produced mixed findings. Overall the results suggested a trend towards a protective effect of caffeine against late-life dementia and Alzheimer’s disease, but no definitive statements could be made. The authors stated the need for larger studies with longer follow-up periods. Randomized controlled trials studying a protective effect of coffee or caffeine on the progression of Alzheimer’s disease and dementia are not yet available. [21-23]

There are various proposed actions of caffeine or components in coffee that may prevent the formation of gallstones. The most common type of gallstone is made of cholesterol. Coffee may prevent cholesterol from forming into crystals in the gallbladder. It may stimulate contractions in the gallbladder and increase the flow of bile so that cholesterol does not collect. [24]
A study of 46,008 men tracked the development of gallstones and their coffee consumption for 10 years. After adjusting for other factors known to cause gallstones, the study concluded that men who consistently drank coffee were significantly less likely to develop gallstones compared to men who did not. [24] A similar large study found the same result in women. [25]
In a large cohort of more than 200,000 participants followed for up to 30 years, an association was found between drinking moderate amounts of coffee and lower risk of early death. Compared with non-drinkers, those who drank 3-5 cups of coffee daily were 15% less likely to die early from all causes, including cardiovascular disease, suicide, and Parkinson’s disease. Both caffeinated and decaffeinated coffee provided benefits. The authors suggested that bioactive compounds in coffee may be responsible for interfering with disease development by reducing inflammation and insulin resistance. [26]
In a large prospective cohort of more than 500,000 people followed for 10 years, an association was found between drinking higher amounts of coffee and lower rates of death from all causes. Compared with non-drinkers, those drinking 6-7 cups daily had a 16% lower risk of early death. [26] A protective association was also found in those who drank 8 or more cups daily. The protective effect was present regardless of a genetic predisposition to either faster or slower caffeine metabolism. Instant and decaffeinated coffee showed a similar health benefit.
The bottom line:A large body of evidence suggests that consumption of caffeinated coffee does not increase the risk of cardiovascular diseases and cancers. In fact, consumption of 3 to 5 standard cups of coffee daily has been consistently associated with a reduced risk of several chronic diseases. [4] However, some individuals may not tolerate higher amounts of caffeine due to symptoms of jitteriness, anxiety, and insomnia. Specifically, those who have difficulty controlling their blood pressure may want to moderate their coffee intake. Pregnant women are also advised to aim for less than 200 mg of caffeine daily, the amount in 2 cups of coffee, because caffeine passes through the placenta into the fetus and has been associated with pregnancy loss and low birth weight. [3, 27] Because of the potential negative side effects some people experience when drinking caffeinated coffee, it is not necessary to start drinking it if you do not already or to increase the amount you currently drink, as there aremany other dietary strategiesto improve your health.Decaffeinated coffee is a good option if one is sensitive to caffeine, and according to the research summarized above, it offers similar health benefits as caffeinated coffee.It’s also important to keep in mind how you enjoy your brew. The extra calories, sugar, and saturated fat in a coffee house beverage loaded with whipped cream and flavored syrup might offset any health benefits found in a basic black coffee.
What about iced coffee?
Types
Coffee beans are the seeds of a fruit called a coffee cherry. Coffee cherries grow on coffee trees from a genus of plants calledCoffea. There are a wide variety of species of coffee plants, ranging from shrubs to trees.
Type of bean.There are two main types of coffee species, Arabica and Robusta. Arabica originates from Ethiopia and produces a mild, flavorful tasting coffee. It is the most popular type worldwide. However, it is expensive to grow because the Arabica plant is sensitive to the environment, requiring shade, humidity, and steady temperatures between 60-75 degrees Fahrenheit. The Robusta coffee plant is more economical to grow because it is resistant to disease and survives in a wider range of temperatures between 65-97 degrees Fahrenheit. It can also withstand harsh climate changes such as variations in rainfall and strong sunlight.
Type of roast.Coffee beans start out green. They are roasted at a high heat to produce a chemical change that releases the rich aroma and flavor that we associate with coffee. They are then cooled and ground for brewing. Roasting levels range from light to medium to dark. The lighter the roast, the lighter the color and roasted flavor and the higher its acidity. Dark roasts produce a black bean with little acidity and a bitter roasted flavor. The popular French roast is medium-dark.
Type of grind.A medium grind is the most common and used for automatic drip coffee makers. A fine grind is used for deeper flavors like espresso, which releases the oils, and a coarse grind is used in coffee presses.
Decaffeinated coffee.This is an option for those who experience unpleasant side effects from caffeine. The two most common methods used to remove caffeine from coffee is to apply chemical solvents (methylene chloride or ethyl acetate) or carbon dioxide gas. Both are applied to steamed or soaked beans, which are then allowed to dry. The solvents bind to caffeine and both evaporate when the beans are rinsed and/or dried. According to U.S. regulations, at least 97% of the caffeine must be removed to carry the decaffeinated label, so there may be trace residual amounts of caffeine. Both methods may cause some loss of flavor as other naturally occurring chemicals in coffee beans that impart their unique flavor and scent may be destroyed during processing.

A plain “black” cup of coffee is a very low calorie drink—8 ounces only contains 2 calories! However, adding sugar, cream, and milk can quickly bump up the calorie counts. A tablespoon of cream contains 52 calories, and a tablespoon of whole milk contains 9 calories. While 9 calories isn’t a lot, milk is often poured into coffee without measuring, so you may be getting several servings of milk or cream in your coffee. A tablespoon of sugar contains 48 calories, so if you take your coffee with cream and sugar, you’re adding over 100 extra calories to your daily cup.
However, the real caloric danger occurs in specialty mochas, lattes, or blended ice coffee drinks. These drinks are often super-sized and can contain anywhere from 200-500 calories, as well as an extremely large amount of sugar. With these drinks, it’s best to enjoy them as a treat or dessert, and stick with plain, minimally sweetened coffee on a regular basis
Store
Place beans or ground coffee in an airtight opaque container at room temperature away from sunlight. Inside a cool dark cabinet would be ideal. Exposure to moisture, air, heat, and light can strip coffee of its flavor. Coffee packaging does not preserve the coffee well for extended periods, so transfer larger amounts of coffee to airtight containers.
Coffee can be frozen if stored in a very airtight container. Exposure to even small amounts of air in the freezer can lead to freezer burn.
Make
Follow directions on the coffee package and your coffee machine, but generally the ratio is 1-2 tablespoons of ground coffee per 6 ounces of water.
For optimal coffee flavor, drink soon after brewing. The beverage will lose flavor with time.
Use ground coffee within a few days and whole beans within two weeks.
Did You Know?
It is a myth that darker roasts contain a higher level of caffeine than lighter roasts. Lighter roasts actually have a slightly higher concentration!
Coffee grinds should not be brewed more than once. Brewed grinds taste bitter and may no longer produce a pleasant coffee flavor.
While water is always the best choice for quenching your thirst, coffee can count towards your daily fluid goals. Although caffeine has a mild diuretic effect, it is offset by the total amount of fluid from the coffee.

Chickpeas (Garbanzo Beans)
The name chickpea comes from the Latin wordcicer, referring to the plant family of legumes, Fabaceae. It is also known by its popular Spanish-derived name, the garbanzo bean. Kidney beans, black beans, lima beans, and peanuts are other familiar foods found in thislegume family. These plants produce edible seeds, called pulses, that have high nutritional value. Two main varieties of chickpeas are the larger round light-colored Kabuli-type, common in the United States, and the smaller dark irregularly shaped Desi-type often used in India and the Middle East.
Chickpeas appear in early recordings in Turkey about 3500 BCE and in France 6790 BCE. India produces the most chickpeas worldwide but they are grown in more than 50 countries. An excellent source of carbohydrate, protein, fiber, B vitamins, and some minerals, they are a nutritious staple of many diets.

Chickpeas and Health
Chickpeas andall pulsescontain several components that, when eaten as part of a balanced plant-rich diet, may help prevent the development of various chronic diseases [1-7]
Diabetes:Both dried and canned chickpeas have alow glycemic index and low glycemic load, and contain amylose, aresistant starchthat digests slowly. These factors help to prevent sudden surges in blood sugar and insulin levels, which can improve overall blood sugar control in people with type 2 diabetes. [1-3,5-7]
Gut Flora:Chickpeas contain a soluble fiber called raffinose, a type of oligosaccharide that is fermented in the colon bybeneficial bacteriacalledBifidobacterium. As bacteria break down this fiber, a short chain fatty acid called butyrate is produced. Butyrate plays a role in reducing inflammation in the cell wall of the colon, promoting regularity in the intestines, and possibly preventing colorectal cancer by promoting cell apoptosis (death). [1,3,4]
Heart Disease:Chickpeas contain a plant sterol called sitosterol that is structurally similar to cholesterol in the body. It interferes with the body’s absorption of cholesterol and thereby can help to lower blood cholesterol levels. The fiber and unsaturated fats in chickpeas may also favorably affect blood lipid levels. [1-3,5-7]
Obesity:High fiber foods can help to promote a feeling of fullness and satiety by delaying digestion and adding bulk to meals. The satiating effect of the high fiber and protein content of chickpeas may help with weight management. [1-3,5,7]
Make
Chickpeas are widely available dried or canned. Occasionally you may find young, fresh green chickpeas in their pods at farmers’ markets.
Dried:Sort through the beans to check for and remove small stones or debris, then place in a strainer and rinse well. To speed up the cooking time, dry beans may be presoaked by covering with water and allowing to sit for at least 3 hours, or overnight. Some people who feel bloated after eating beans may find that presoaked beans are better tolerated, as this reduces the amount of oligosaccharides that are responsible for the uncomfortable side effects.Cook:For 1 cup of dry garbanzo beans, add 3 cups of water or broth. Add to pan and bring to a boil. When boiling, reduce the heat to low-medium and simmer for 60-90 minutes or until desired tenderness. Add more water if the beans do not reach desired tenderness and further cook time is needed. Using presoaked beans will reduce the cook time by 25%.

Using presoaked beans will reduce the cook time by 25%.
Canned:Place in a strainer, drain, and rinse well. This will remove about 40% of the sodium, or you can purchase low sodium or no-salt-added canned versions. These do not need additional cooking but hold up well when added to cooked or baked dishes.
Serve
Chickpeas have a nutty buttery flavor and creamy texture that can enhance many recipes. There are various ways to incorporate cooked chickpeas:
Add to salads, soups, and stews.
Use a food processor or blender to grind into a paste and add to veggie burgers or meatless meatballs.
Season and roast for a tasty snack.
Blend with tahini, garlic, olive oil, and lemon juice to make a hummus spread.
Mash and use in baking as a replacement for flour.

Did You Know?
Roasted and ground chickpeas have been used as a caffeine-free alternative to coffee for centuries. The beverage is also available as ready-to-brew commercial brands in some grocery stores.
Don’t throw out chickpea liquid, either from canned beans or from cooking the bean! It is called aquafaba, a thick liquid containing a mix of starch and trace amounts of protein, with emulsifying, binding, and thickening properties. It works well as a flavorless, odorless egg replacer in recipes: 1 tablespoon of aquafaba = 1 egg yolk, 2 tablespoons = 1 egg white, and 3 tablespoons = 1 one whole egg. It can also be whipped to replace the eggs in meringues or mayonnaise.
Unlike many canned vegetables, canned chickpeas retain much of their nutritional value and are comparable to dried cooked versions.

Abstract
Chickpea (Cicer arietinumL.) is an important pulse crop grown and consumed all over the world, especially in the Afro-Asian countries. It is a good source of carbohydrates and protein, and protein quality is considered to be better than other pulses. Chickpea has significant amounts of all the essential amino acids except sulphur-containing amino acids, which can be complemented by adding cereals to the daily diet. Starch is the major storage carbohydrate followed by dietary fibre, oligosaccharides and simple sugars such as glucose and sucrose. Although lipids are present in low amounts, chickpea is rich in nutritionally important unsaturated fatty acids such as linoleic and oleic acids. β-Sitosterol, campesterol and stigmasterol are important sterols present in chickpea oil. Ca, Mg, P and, especially, K are also present in chickpea seeds. Chickpea is a good source of important vitamins such as riboflavin, niacin, thiamin, folate and the vitamin A precursor β-carotene. As with other pulses, chickpea seeds also contain anti-nutritional factors which can be reduced or eliminated by different cooking techniques. Chickpea has several potential health benefits, and, in combination with other pulses and cereals, it could have beneficial effects on some of the important human diseases such as CVD, type 2 diabetes, digestive diseases and some cancers. Overall, chickpea is an important pulse crop with a diverse array of potential nutritional and health benefits.

Chickpea (Cicer arietinumL.), also called garbanzo bean or Bengal gram, is an Old-World pulse and one of the seven Neolithic founder crops in the Fertile Crescent of the Near East(Reference Lev-Yadun, Gopher and Abbo1). Currently, chickpea is grown in over fifty countries across the Indian subcontinent, North Africa, the Middle East, southern Europe, the Americas and Australia. Globally, chickpea is the third most important pulse crop in production, next to dry beans and field peas(2). During 2006–9, the global chickpea production area was about 11·3 million ha, with a production of 9·6 million metric tonnes and an average yield of 849 kg/ha(2). India is the largest chickpea-producing country with an average production of 6·38 million metric tonnes during 2006–9, accounting for 66 % of global chickpea production(2). The other major chickpea-producing countries include Pakistan, Turkey, Australia, Myanmar, Ethiopia, Iran, Mexico, Canada and the USA.
There are two distinct types of cultivated chickpea: Desi and Kabuli. The Desi (microsperma) types have pink flowers, anthocyanin pigmentation on stems, and a coloured and thick seed coat. The Kabuli (macrosperma) types have white flowers, lack anthocyanin pigmentation on stems, and have white or beige-coloured seeds with a ram's head shape, a thin seed coat and a smooth seed surface(Reference Moreno and Cubero3). In addition, an intermediate type with pea-shaped seeds of local importance is recognised in India. The seed weight generally ranges from 0·1 to 0·3 g and 0·2 to 0·6 g in the Desi and Kabuli types, respectively(Reference Frimpong, Sinha and Tar'an4). The Desi types account for about 80–85 % of the total chickpea area and are mostly grown in Asia and Africa(Reference Pande, Siddique and Kishore5). The Kabuli types are largely grown in West Asia, North Africa, North America and Europe.
There is a growing demand for chickpea due to its nutritional value. In the semi-arid tropics, chickpea is an important component of the diets of those individuals who cannot afford animal proteins or those who are vegetarian by choice. Chickpea is a good source of carbohydrates and protein, together constituting about 80 % of the total dry seed mass(Reference Chibbar, Ambigaipalan and Hoover6,Reference Geervani7)in comparison with other pulses. Chickpea is cholesterol free and is a good source of dietary fibre (DF), vitamins and minerals(8,Reference Wood, Grusak, Yadav, Redden, Chen and Sharma9).
Globally, chickpea is mostly consumed as a seed food in several different forms and preparations are determined by ethnic and regional factors(Reference Muehlbauer and Tullu10,Reference Ibrikci, Knewtson and Grusak11). In the Indian subcontinent, chickpea is split (cotyledons) as ‘dhal’ and ground to make flour (‘besan’) that is used to prepare different snacks(Reference Chavan, Kadam and Salunkhe12,Reference Hulse13). In other parts of the world, especially in Asia and Africa, chickpea is used in stews and soups/salads, and consumed in roasted, boiled, salted and fermented forms(Reference Gecit14). These different forms of consumption provide consumers with valuable nutritional and potential health benefits.
Although chickpea is a member of the ‘founder crop package’(Reference Zohary and Hopf15)with potential nutritional/medicinal qualities, it has not received due attention for research like other founder crops (e.g. wheat or barley). Chickpea has been consumed by humans since ancient times owing to its good nutritional properties. Furthermore, chickpea is of interest as a functional food with potential beneficial effects on human health. Although other publications have described the physico-chemical and nutritional characteristics of chickpea, there is limited information on the relationship between its nutritional components and health benefits. This review attempts to bridge this void and investigates the literature regarding the nutritional value of chickpeas and their potential health benefits.
Chickpea grain composition
Classification of carbohydrates
Dietary carbohydrates are classified into two groups: (1) available (mono- and disaccharides), which are enzymatically digested in the small intestine, and (2) unavailable (oligosaccharides, resistant starch, non-cellulosic polysaccharides, pectins, hemicelluloses and cellulose), which are not digested in the small intestine(Reference Chibbar, Baga, Ganeshan, Wrigley, Corke and Walker16). The total carbohydrate content in chickpea is higher than that in pulses (Table 2). Chickpea contains monosaccharides (ribose, glucose, galactose and fructose), disaccharides (sucrose and maltose) and oligosaccharides (stachyose, ciceritol, raffinose and verbascose) (Table 1). The amount of these fractions varies, though not significantly, between the Desi and Kabuli genotypes (Table 1).

∥Expressed as g/kg.
Mono-, di- and oligosaccharides
Sánchez-Mataet al.(Reference Sánchez-Mata, Peñuela-Teruel and Cámara-Hurtado17)reported the following monosaccharide concentrations in chickpea: galactose, 0·05 g/100 g; ribose, 0·11 g/100 g; fructose, 0·25 g/100 g; glucose, 0·7 g/100 g. Maltose (0·6 %) and sucrose (1–2 %) have been reported to be the most abundant free disaccharides in chickpea(Reference Wood, Grusak, Yadav, Redden, Chen and Sharma9). Pulse seeds contain some of the highest concentrations of oligosaccharides among all the crops. Oligosaccharides are not absorbed or hydrolysed by the human digestive system but fermented by colonic bacteria to release gases or flatulence(Reference Kozlowska, Aranda and Dostalova18). α-Galactosides are the second most abundant carbohydrates in the plant kingdom after sucrose(Reference Jones, DuPont and Ambrose19,Reference Han and Baik20), and in chickpea, they account for about 62 % of total sugar (mono-, di- and oligosaccharides) content(Reference Sánchez-Mata, Peñuela-Teruel and Cámara-Hurtado17). The two important groups of α-galactosides present in chickpea are as follows: (1) raffinose family of oligosaccharides, including raffinose (trisaccharide), stachyose (tetrasaccharide) and verbascose (pentasaccharide)(Reference Han and Baik20), and (2) galactosyl cyclitols, including ciceritol (Table 1)(Reference Bernabé, Fenwick and Frias21). Ciceritol was isolated for the first time from chickpea seeds by Quemener & Brillouet(Reference Quemener and Brillouet22)and later confirmed by Bernabéet al.(Reference Bernabé, Fenwick and Frias21). Ciceritol and stachyose, two important galactosides in chickpea, constitute 36–43 % and 25 %, respectively, of total sugars (mono-, di- and oligosaccharides) in chickpea seeds(Reference Sánchez-Mata, Peñuela-Teruel and Cámara-Hurtado17,Reference Aguilera, Martín-Cabrejas and Benítez23).
α-Galactosides are neither absorbed nor hydrolysed in the upper gastrointestinal tract of humans, accumulating in the large intestine of the human digestive system. Humans lack α-galactosidase, the enzyme responsible for degrading these oligosaccharides(Reference Han and Baik20). Therefore, α-galactosides undergo microbial fermentation by colonic bacteria resulting in the production of hydrogen, methane and CO2, major components of flatulent gases(Reference Singh24). The expulsion of these gases is responsible for abdominal discomfort. Gas production is higher following chickpea consumption compared with other pulses, and this could be due to a higher content of oligosaccharides in chickpea(Reference Jaya, Naik and Venkataraman25,Reference Rao and Belavady26). Germination decreases the raffinose, stachyose and verbascose content(Reference Åman27). Chickpea has lower values for the absolute content of flatulent α-galactosides (1·56 g/100 g) compared with other pulses such as white beans (2·46 g/100 g), lentils (2·44 g/100 g) and pinto beans (2·30 g/100 g)(Reference Sánchez-Mata, Peñuela-Teruel and Cámara-Hurtado17).
Polysaccharides
Polysaccharides are high-molecular-weight polymers of monosaccharides present as storage carbohydrates (e.g. starch) or structural carbohydrates (e.g. cellulose) providing structural support(Reference Wood, Grusak, Yadav, Redden, Chen and Sharma9). Among the storage polysaccharides, chickpea has been reported to synthesise and store starch and not galactomannans(Reference Wood, Grusak, Yadav, Redden, Chen and Sharma9). Starch is the major storage carbon reserve in pulse seeds(Reference Chibbar, Ambigaipalan and Hoover6). It is made up of two large glucan polymers, amylose and amylopectin, in which the glucose residues are linked by α-(1 → 4) bonds to form a linear molecule and the linear molecule is branched by α-(1 → 6) linkages(Reference Chibbar, Ambigaipalan and Hoover6). The side chains of amylopectin are packed into different polymorphic forms in the lamellae of starch grains: ‘A’ type in cereals and ‘C’ type in pulses. The ‘C’ polymorph is considered to be of the intermediate type between the ‘A’ polymorph in cereals and the ‘B’ polymorph in tubers in packing density and structure(Reference Chibbar, Ambigaipalan and Hoover6). The content of starch varies from 41 to 50 % of the total carbohydrates(Reference Jambunathan and Singh28–Reference Özer, Karaköy and Toklu30), with the Kabuli types having more soluble sugars (sucrose, glucose and fructose) compared with the Desi types(Reference Jambunathan and Singh28). The total starch content of chickpea seeds has been reported to be about 525 g/kg DM, about 35 % of total starch has been considered to be resistant starch and the remaining 65 % as available starch(Reference Aguilera, Martín-Cabrejas and Benítez23,Reference Aguilera, Esteban and Benítez31). Cereals such as wheat have a higher amount of starch compared with chickpea(32), but chickpea seeds have a higher amylose content (30–40v. 25 % in wheat)(Reference Williams, Singh, Saxena and Singh33,Reference Guillon and Champ34).In vitrostarch digestibility values (ISDV) of chickpea vary from 37 to 60 %(Reference Zia-Ul-Haq, Iqbal and Ahmad35,Reference Khalil, Zeb and Mahood36)and are higher than other pulses such black grams, lentils and kidney beans(Reference Rehman and Shah37). However, thein vitrostarch digestibility values of pulses, in general, are lower than cereals due to a higher amylose content(Reference Madhusudhan and Tharanathan38).
Dietary fibre
DF is the indigestible part of plant food in the human small intestine. It is composed of poly/oligosaccharides, lignin and other plant-based substances(39). DF can be classified into soluble and insoluble fibres. The soluble fibre is digested slowly in the colon, whereas the insoluble fibre is metabolically inert and aids in bowel movement(Reference Tosh and Yada40). The insoluble fibre undergoes fermentation aiding in the growth of colonic bacteria(Reference Tosh and Yada40). The total DF content (DFC) in chickpea is 18–22 g/100 g of raw chickpea seed(Reference Aguilera, Martín-Cabrejas and Benítez23,Reference Tosh and Yada40), and it has a higher amount of DF among pulses (Table 2). Soluble and insoluble DFC are about 4–8 and 10–18 g/100 g of raw chickpea seed, respectively(Reference Dalgetty and Baik29,Reference Rincón, Martínez and Ibáñez41). The fibre content of chickpea hulls on a dry weight basis is lower (75 %) compared with lentils (87 %) and peas (89 %)(Reference Dalgetty and Baik29). The lower DFC in chickpea hulls can be attributed to the difficulty in separating the hull from the cotyledon during milling.
Table 2Nutrient composition (g/100 g) of different legumes(32)
TDF, total dietary fibre.
The DFC of chickpea seeds is equal to or higher than that of other pulses such as lentils (Lens culinaris) and dry peas (Pisum sativum)(Reference Tosh and Yada40). The Desi types have a higher total DFC and insoluble DFC compared with the Kabuli types. This could be due to thicker hulls and seed coat in the Desi types (11·5 % of total seed weight) compared with the Kabuli types (only 4·3–4·4 % of total seed weight)(Reference Rincón, Martínez and Ibáñez41). Further, Woodet al.(Reference Wood, Knights and Choct42)have reported that the thinner seed coat in the Kabuli types is due to thinner palisade and parenchyma layers with fewer polysaccharides. Usually, no significant differences are found in soluble DFC between the Kabuli and Desi types due to the similar proportion of hemicelluloses that constitute a large part (about 55 %) of the total seed DF in the Kabuli and Desi types(Reference Singh43). The hemicellulosic sugar arabinose/rhamnose is present in appreciable amounts in hull and insoluble fibre fractions of chickpea(Reference Dalgetty and Baik29). Glucose is present in large amounts in hull and soluble fibre fractions of chickpea. Xylose is the major constituent of soluble fibre fractions in chickpea(Reference Dalgetty and Baik29).
Protein content
Protein–energy malnutrition is observed in infants and young children in developing countries, and includes a range of pathological conditions arising due to the lack of protein and energy in the diet(Reference Haider and Haider44). Malnutrition affects about 170 million people, especially preschool children and nursing mothers of developing countries in Asia and Africa(Reference Iqbal, Khalil and Ateeq45). Pulses provide a major share of protein and energy in the Afro-Asian diet. Among the different pulses, chickpea has been reported to have a higher protein bioavailability(Reference Yust, Pedroche and Giron-Calle46,Reference Sánchez-Vioque, Clemente and Vioque47).
The protein content in chickpea significantly varies as a percentage of the total dry seed mass before (17–22 %) and after (25·3–28·9 %) dehulling(Reference Hulse13,Reference Badshah, Khan and Bibi48). The differences in the crude protein concentration of Kabuli and Desi types have been inconsistent, showing significant differences in one instance (241 g/kg in ‘Kabuli’v. 217 g/kg in ‘Desi’)(Reference Singh and Jambunathan49)and no differences in another instance (217 g/kg in ‘Kabuli’v. 215 g/kg in ‘Desi’)(Reference Rincón, Martínez and Ibáñez41). The seed protein content of eight annual wild species of the genusCicerranged from 168 g/kg inCicer cuneatumto 268 g/kg inCicer pinnatifidum, with an average of 207 g/kg over the eight wild species(Reference Ocampo, Robertson and Singh50). Chickpea protein quality is better than some pulse crops such as black gram (Vigna mungoL.), green gram (Vigna radiataL.) and red gram (Cajanus cajanL.)(Reference Kaur, Singh and Sodhi51). Additionally, there is no significant difference in the protein concentration of raw chickpea seeds compared with some pulses such as black gram, lentils, red kidney bean and white kidney bean(Reference Rehman and Shah37).
Protein digestibility
Thein vitroprotein digestibility of raw chickpea seeds varies from 34 to 76 %(Reference Khalil, Zeb and Mahood36,Reference Khattak, Zeb and Bibi52,Reference Clemente, Sánchez-Vioque and Vioque53). Chitraet al.(Reference Chitra, Vimala and Singh54)found higherin vitroprotein digestibility values for chickpea genotypes (65·3–79·4 %) compared with those for pigeon pea (C. cajan; 60·4–74·4 %), mung bean (V. radiata; 67·2–72·2 %), urd bean (V. mungo; 55·7–63·3 %) and soyabean (Glycine max; 62·7–71·6 %). The digestibility of protein from the Kabuli types is higher than that from the Desi types(Reference Sánchez-Vioque, Clemente and Vioque47,Reference Paredes-López, Ordorica-Falomir and Olivares-Vázquez55).
Amino acid profile
The amino acid profiles of chickpea seeds are presented inTable 3. There are some minor variations in the quantity of a few amino acids such as lysine, tyrosine, glutamic acid, histidine and the two combined aromatic amino acids (Table 3)(Reference Iqbal, Khalil and Ateeq45). Generally, sulphur-rich amino acids (methionine and cystine) are limiting in pulses. Commonly consumed food pulses such as chickpea, field pea, green pea, lentils and common beans have about 1·10 g/16 g N of methionine and cystine(Reference Wang and Daun56), the exceptions being cowpea, which has about 2·20 g/16 g N of methionine, and green pea, which has about 1·80 g/16 g N of cystine(Reference Iqbal, Khalil and Ateeq45). There are no significant differences in the amino acid profiles of Kabuli- and Desi-type chickpeas(Reference Wang and Daun56,Reference Wang, Gao and Zhang57). Amino acid deficiencies in chickpea (or other pulses) could be complemented by consuming cereals, which are rich in sulphur-containing amino acids(Reference Zia-Ul-Haq, Iqbal and Ahmad35). Pulses are usually consumed along with cereals, especially in Asian countries, thereby allowing the daily dietary amino acid requirements to be met.

Fat content and fatty acid profile
The total fat content in raw chickpea seeds varies from 2·70 to 6·48 %(Reference Kaur, Singh and Sodhi51,Reference Alajaji and El-Adawy58). Shadet al.(Reference Shad, Pervez and Zafar59)reported lower values (about 2·05 g/100 g) for crude fat content in Desi-type chickpea varieties. Wood & Grusak(Reference Wood, Grusak, Yadav, Redden, Chen and Sharma9)reported a fat content of 3·40–8·83 and 2·90–7·42 % in Kabuli- and Desi-type chickpea seeds, respectively. Further, even higher levels (3·80–10·20 %) of fat content in chickpea have been reported(Reference Singh24). The fat content in chickpea (6·04 g/100 g) is higher than that in other pulses such as lentils (1·06 g/100 g), red kidney bean (1·06 g/100 g), mung bean (1·15 g/100 g) and pigeon pea (1·64 g/100 g), and also in cereals such as wheat (1·70 g/100 g) and rice (about 0·60 g/100 g)(32). Chickpea is composed of about 66 % PUFA, about 19 % MUFA and about 15 % SFA (Table 4). On average, oleic acid (OA) was higher in the Kabuli types and linoleic acid (LA) was higher in the Desi types (Table 4). Chickpea is a relatively good source of nutritionally important PUFA, LA (51·2 %) and monounsaturated OA (32·6 %). Chickpea has higher amounts of LA and OA compared with other edible pulses such as lentils (44·4 % LA; 20·9 % OA), peas (45·6 % LA; 23·2 % OA) and beans (46·7 % LA; 28·1 % OA)(Reference Wang and Daun56). LA is the dominant fatty acid in chickpea followed by OA and palmitic acid (Table 4).

Oil characteristics
Chickpea cannot be considered as an oilseed crop since its oil content is relatively low (3·8–10 %)(Reference Singh24,Reference Gül, Ömer and Turhan60)in comparison with other important oilseed pulses such as soyabean or groundnut. However, chickpea oil has medicinal and nutritionally important tocopherols, sterols and tocotrienols(Reference Zia-Ul-Haq, Ahmad and Iqbal61). The content of different sterols and tocopherols in chickpea is presented inTable 5. Sitosterol (72·52–76·10 %;Table 5) is the dominant sterol in chickpea oil followed by campesterol. The α-tocopherol content reported by the United States Department of Agriculture(32)is lower than the other reported values inTable 5. However, the α-tocopherol content in chickpea is relatively higher (8·2 mg/100 g) than other pulses such as lentils (4·9 mg/100 g), green pea (1·3 mg/100 g), red kidney bean (2·1 mg/100 g) and mung bean (5·1 mg/100 g)(32). The α-tocopherol content, coupled with the concentration of δ-tocopherol, which is a potent antioxidant property(Reference Tsaknis62), makes chickpea oil oxidatively stable and contributes to a better shelf life during storage(Reference Zia-ul-Haq, Ahmad and Ahmad63). TAG is the predominant neutral lipid in Desi chickpea oil and phospholipids are also found in oil(Reference Zia-Ul-Haq, Ahmad and Iqbal61).

*The type of chickpea is not specified.
The physico-chemical characteristics of chickpea oil are summarised inTable 6. The relative index values of chickpea (1·49) are higher than those of soyabean (1·46) and groundnut (1·47), the two important oil-bearing pulses(Reference Kirk and Sawyer64). The iodine values of chickpea oil (111·87–113·69, Wijs method) were also higher than the iodine values of groundnut (80–106, Wijs method) andPhaseolus vulgaris(80·5–92·3, Wijs method)(Reference Zia-Ul-Haq, Ahmad and Iqbal61,Reference Mabaleha and Yeboah65). Higher refractive index and iodine values indicate substantial unsaturation in chickpea oil, which is demonstrated by the dominance of LA content(Reference Zia-Ul-Haq, Ahmad and Iqbal61)(Table 4). The lower acid values observed for chickpea (Table 6) make its oil refining easier(Reference Siddhuraju, Becker and Makkar66). The peroxide value for chickpea oils (3·97–6·37 mequiv/kg;Table 6) was within the maximum limit of the Codex recommendation (10 mequiv/kg) for edible oils(Reference Kirk and Sawyer64).

Minerals
Chickpea, like other pulses, not only brings variety to the cereal-based daily diet of millions of people in Asia and Africa, but also provides essential vitamins and minerals(Reference Cabrera, Lloris and Giménez67,Reference Duhan, Khetarpaul and Bishnoi68). The different minerals present in chickpea seeds are presented inTable 7. Raw chickpea seeds (100 g) on an average provide about 5·0 mg/100 g of Fe, 4·1 mg/100 g of Zn, 138 mg/100 g of Mg and 160 mg/100 g of Ca. About 100 g of chickpea seeds can meet the daily dietary requirements of Fe (1·05 mg/d in males and 1·46 mg/d in females) and Zn (4·2 mg/d in males and 3·0 mg/d in females) and 200 g can meet that of Mg (260 mg/d in males and 220 mg/d in females)(69). There were no significant differences between the Kabuli and Desi genotypes except for Ca, with the Desi types having a higher content than the Kabuli types(Reference Wang and Daun56,Reference Ibáñez, Rinch and Amaro70). The amount of total Fe present in chickpea is lower (5·45 mg/100 g) compared with other pulse crops such as lentils (8·60 mg/100 g) and beans (7·48 mg/100 g)(Reference Quinteros, Farre and Lagarda71). Data on other minerals present in chickpea are very limited. Se, a nutritionally important essential trace element, is also found in chickpea seeds (8·2 μg/100 g)(32,Reference Cabrera, Lloris and Giménez67). Chickpea has been reported to have other trace elements including Al (10·2 μg/g), Cr (0·12 μg/g), Ni (0·26 μg/g), Pb (0·48 μg/g) and Cd (0·01 μg/g)(32,Reference Cabrera, Lloris and Giménez67). The quantities reported here for Al, Ni, Pb and Cd do not pose any toxicological risk.

*The type of chickpea is not specified.
Vitamins
Vitamins are required in tiny quantities; this requirement is met through a well-balanced daily diet of cereals, pulses, vegetables, fruits, meat and dairy products. Pulses are a good source of vitamins. As shown inTable 8, chickpea can complement the vitamin requirement of an individual when consumed with other foods. Chickpea is a relatively inexpensive and good source of folic acid and tocopherols (both γ and α;Table 8)(Reference Ciftci, Ozkaya and Cevrimli72). It is a relatively good source of folic acid coupled with more modest amounts of water-soluble vitamins such as riboflavin (B2), pantothenic acid (B5) and pyridoxine (B6), and these levels are similar to or higher than those observed in other pulses (Table 9)(Reference Lebiedzińska and Szefer73). However, niacin concentration in chickpea is lower than that in pigeon pea and lentils (Table 9)(Reference Singh and Diwakar74).

Carotenoids
Plant carotenoids are lipid-soluble antioxidants/pigments responsible for bright colours (usually red, yellow and orange) of different plant tissues(Reference Bartley and Scolnik75). Carotenoids are classified into two types: (1) oxygenated, referred to as xanthophylls, which includes lutein, violaxanthin and neoxanthin, and (2) non-oxygenated, referred to as carotenes, which includes β-carotene and lycopene(Reference DellaPenna and Pogson76). The important carotenoids present in chickpea include β-carotene (Table 8), lutein, zeaxanthin, β-cryptoxanthin, lycopene and α-carotene. The average concentration of carotenoids (except lycopene) is higher in wild accessions of chickpea than in cultivated varieties or landraces (cv.Hadas)(Reference Abbo, Molina and Jungmann77). β-Carotene is the most important and widely distributed carotenoid in plants and is converted into vitamin A more efficiently than the other carotenoids(Reference Abbo, Molina and Jungmann77). On a dry seed weight basis, chickpea has a higher amount of β-carotene than ‘golden rice’ endosperm(Reference Abbo, Molina and Jungmann77,Reference Ye, Babili and Kioti78)or red-coloured wheats(32).
Isoflavones
Chickpea seeds contain several phenolic compounds(Reference Wood, Grusak, Yadav, Redden, Chen and Sharma9). Of these, two important phenolic compounds found in chickpea are the isoflavones biochanin A (5,7-dihydroxy-4′-methoxyisoflavone) and formononetin (7-hydroxy-4′-methoxyisoflavone)(Reference Wood, Grusak, Yadav, Redden, Chen and Sharma9). Other phenolic compounds detected in chickpea oil are daidzein, genistein, matairesinol and secoisolariciresinol(Reference Dixon79,Reference Champ80). The concentration of biochanin A is higher in Kabuli-type seeds (1420–3080 μg/100 g) compared with Desi-type seeds (838 μg/100 g)(Reference Mazur, Duke and Wahala81). The amount of formononetin in Kabuli- and Desi-type seeds is 215 μg/100 g and 94–126 μg/100 g, respectively(Reference Mazur, Duke and Wahala81).
Anti-nutritional factors
Despite the potential nutritional and health-promoting value of anti-nutritional factor (ANF), their presence in chickpea limits its biological value and usage as food. ANF interfere with digestion and also make the seed unpalatable when consumed in raw form by monogastric animal species(Reference Domoney, Shewry and Casey82). ANF can be divided into protein and non-protein ANF(Reference Duranti and Gius83). The non-protein ANF include alkaloids, tannins, phytic acid, saponins and phenolics, while the protein ANF include trypsin inhibitors, chymotrypsin inhibitors, lectins and antifungal peptides (Table 10)(Reference Roy, Boye and Simpson84,Reference Muzquiz, Wood, Yadav, Redden, Chen and Sharma85). Chickpea protease inhibitors are of two types: (1) Kunitz type – single-chain polypeptides of about 20 kDa with two disulphide bridges which inhibit the enzyme activity of trypsin but not chymotrypsin(Reference Srinivasan, Giri and Harsulkar86); and (2) Bowman–Birk inhibitors – which are also single-chain polypeptides of about 8 kDa in size with seven disulphide bridges which inhibit the enzyme activity of both trypsin and chymotrypsin(Reference Smirnoff, Khalef and Birk87,Reference Guillamon, Pedrosa and Burbano88). Protease inhibitors interfere with digestion by irreversibly binding with trypsin and chymotrypsin in the human digestive tract. They are resistant to the digestive enzyme pepsin and the stomach's acidic pH(Reference Roy, Boye and Simpson84). They negatively affect certain necessary enzymatic modifications required during food processing such as water-retaining capacity, gel-forming and foaming ability of different products(Reference Garcia-Cerreno89).

Phytic acid can bind to several important divalent cations (e.g. Fe, Zn, Ca and Mg) forming insoluble complexes and making them unavailable for absorption and utilisation in the small intestine(Reference Sandberg90–Reference Cheryan92). Tannins inhibit enzymes, reducing the digestibility and making chickpea astringent. Saponins are commonly found in several pulses including chickpea (Table 10)(Reference Oakenful and Sidhu93), giving the pulses a bitter taste and making them less preferable for consumption by humans and animals(Reference Birk, Peri and Liener94). Saponin content in chickpea (56 g/kg) is higher than that in other pulses such as green gram (16 g/kg), lentils (3·7–4·6 g/kg), faba bean (4·3 g/kg) and broad bean (3·5 g/kg)(Reference Gupta95).
Though the ANF act as limiting factors in chickpea consumption, they can be reduced or eliminated by soaking, cooking, boiling and autoclaving(Reference Alajaji and El-Adawy58). The ANF also have beneficial effects, which are discussed below.
Health benefits
Although pulses have been consumed for thousands of years for their nutritional qualities(Reference Kerem, Lev-Yadun and Gopher96), it is only during the past two to three decades that interest in pulses as food and their potential impact on human health has been revived. Chickpea consumption has been reported to have some physiological benefits that may reduce the risk of chronic diseases and optimise health (discussed in detail in the following paragraphs). Therefore, chickpeas could potentially be considered as a ‘functional food’ in addition to their accepted role of providing proteins and fibre. Different definitions are proposed that describe functional foods as: (1) ‘one encompassing healthful products, including modified food or ingredient that may provide health benefits beyond traditional ingredients’(Reference Milner97); (2) ‘foods that, by virtue of the presence of physiologically-active components, provide a health benefit beyond basic nutrition’(Reference Hasler98). As discussed above, chickpea is a relatively inexpensive source of different vitamins, minerals(Reference Wood, Grusak, Yadav, Redden, Chen and Sharma9,Reference Duke99,Reference Huisman, Van der Poel, Muehlbauer and Kaiser100)and several bioactive compounds (phytates, phenolic compounds, oligosaccharides, enzyme inhibitors, etc.) that could aid in potentially lowering the risk of chronic diseases. Due to its potential nutritional value, chickpea is gaining consumer acceptance as a functional food. Recent reports of the importance of chickpea consumption in relation to health are discussed below.
CVD, CHD and cholesterol control
In general, increased consumption of soluble fibre from foods results in reduced serum total cholesterol and LDL-cholesterol (LDL-C) and has an inverse correlation with CHD mortality(Reference Kushi, Meyer and Jacobs101–Reference Fehily and Sadler106). Usually, pulses and cereals have a comparable ratio of soluble to insoluble fibres per 100 g serving (about 1:3)(Reference Van Horn107). Chickpea seeds are a relatively cheap source of DF and bioactive compounds (e.g. phytosterols, saponins and oligosaccharides); coupled with its low glycaemic index (GI), chickpea may be useful for lowering the risk of CVD(Reference Duranti108). Chickpea has a higher total DFC (about 18–22 g)(Reference Tosh and Yada40)compared with wheat (about 12·7 g)(Reference Pittaway, Ahuja and Robertson109)and a higher amount of fat compared with most other pulses or cereals(Reference Williams, Singh, Saxena and Singh33,Reference Messina110). However, two PUFA, LA and OA, constitute almost about 50–60 % of chickpea fat. Intake of PUFA such as LA (the dominant fatty acid in chickpea;Table 4) has been shown to have a beneficial effect on serum lipids, insulin sensitivity and haemostatic factors, thereby it could be helpful in lowering the risk of CHD(Reference Hu, Manson and Willett111,Reference Sanders, Oakley and Miller112).
Isoflavones are diphenolic secondary metabolites that may lower the incidence of heart disease due to (1) the inhibition of LDL-C oxidation(Reference Tikkanen and Adlercreutz113,Reference Tikkanen, Wahala and Ojala114), (2) the inhibition of proliferation of aortic smooth muscle cells(Reference Pan, Ikeda and Takebe115)and (3) the maintenance of the physical properties of arterial walls(Reference van der Schouw, Pijpe and Lebrun116). Ferulic andp-coumaric acids are polyphenols that are found in chickpea seeds at low concentrations, and these have been shown to reduce blood lipid levels in rats(Reference Sharma117,Reference Sharma118). β-Carotene, the most studied carotenoid, is also present in chickpea seeds. Some cross-sectional and prospective studies have shown an inverse relationship between the incidence of CVD and plasma levels of antioxidants such as β-carotene and vitamin E(Reference Su, Bui and Kardinaal119). However, a large-scale randomised controlled trial (RCT) involving 22 071 healthy individuals demonstrated no benefit or harm of β-carotene supplementation (50 mg on alternate days) on CVD, although this study concluded that β-carotene supplementation could have some apparent benefits on subsequent vascular events(Reference Christen, Gaziano and Hennekens120). These neutral results have also been supported by several other intervention and prevention trials as reviewed by Stanneret al.(Reference Stanner, Hughes and Kelly121). Therefore, despite the evidence supporting the increased occurrence of CVD with a low intake of antioxidants or low levels of antioxidants in the plasma, there is at present no evidence from intervention trials to support the beneficial effect of β-carotene on CVD or CHD. The role of β-carotene, along with other vitamins or nutrients, in helping to reduce the incidence of CVD needs to be further investigated.
Foods rich in saponins have been reported to reduce plasma cholesterol by 16–24 %(Reference Thompson122). The mechanism of cholesterol reduction is by binding to dietary cholesterol(Reference Gestener, Assa and Henis123)or bile acids, thereby increasing their excretion through faeces(Reference Sidhu and Oakenful124,Reference Zulet and Martínez125). β-Sitosterol (the dominant phytosterol in chickpea) is helpful in decreasing serum cholesterol levels and the incidence of CHD(Reference Ling and Jones126–Reference Moreau, Whitaker and Hicks128). A higher intake of folic acid helps in reducing serum homocysteine concentrations, a risk factor for CHD(Reference Albert, Cook and Gaziano129). Folic acid supplementation has been shown to reduce homocysteine levels by 13·4–51·7 %(Reference Baker, Picton and Blackwood130–Reference Bazzano, Reynolds and Holder132). However, although a meta-analysis has shown an association between elevated levels of homocysteine and the risk of CHD and stroke(133), there are no RCT that indicate a benefit of folic acid supplementation on the risk of CVD, CHD or stroke.
A fibre-rich chickpea-based pulse (non-soyabean) diet has been shown to reduce the total plasma cholesterol levels in obese subjects(Reference Crujeiras, Parra and Abete134). This study was conducted on thirty obese subjects (BMI 32·0 (sd5·3) kg/m2) with a mean age group of 36 (sd8) years. The subjects were divided into two groups of fifteen each and fed with a hypoenergetic diet consisting of a chickpea-based pulse diet and a control diet (no pulses) for a period of 8 weeks (4 d/week). After 8 weeks, the total cholesterol levels in the chickpea-based pulse diet-fed group decreased from 215 to 182 mg/dl, whereas a smaller decrease (181 to 173 mg/dl) was observed for the control diet-fed group(Reference Crujeiras, Parra and Abete134). The proposed mechanism for this hypocholesterolaemic effect is the inhibition of fatty acid synthesis in the liver by fibre fermentation products such as propionate, butyrate and acetate(Reference Crujeiras, Parra and Abete134). SCFA (e.g. propionate) have been shown to inhibit both cholesterol and fatty acid biosynthesis by inhibiting acetate (provides acetyl-CoA) utilisation(Reference Wright, Anderson and Bridges135). Feeding a chickpea diet to rats also resulted in a favourable plasma lipid profile(Reference Yang, Zhou and Gu136). In this study, thirty healthy male ‘Sprague–Dawley’ rats were fed three different diets for 8 months: a normal-fat diet (5 g fat, 22 g protein and 1381 kJ/100 g); a high-fat diet (HFD; lard 20 % (w/w), sugar 4 % (w/w), milk powder 2 % (w/w) and cholesterol 1 % (w/w) into standard laboratory chow, which contained 25·71 g fat, 19·54 g protein and 1987 kJ/100 g diet); a HFD plus chickpea diet (same as the HFD, but 10 % crushed chickpea seeds replaced the standard chow; it contained 25·11 g fat, 19·36 g protein and 1965 kJ/100 g). Several pro-atherogenic factors, including TAG, LDL-C and LDL-C:HDL-cholesterol ratio, decreased with consuming the chickpea-based diet(Reference Yang, Zhou and Gu136). In eighty-four healthy ‘Sprague–Dawley’ rats divided into fourteen groups of six each fed diets containing chickpea (49–65·4 % of diet) and peas (46–62 % of diet) for 35 d, lower levels of plasma cholesterol were recorded(Reference Wang and McIntosh137). The decrease in cholesterol levels varied with the processing method used; extrusion and boiling had similar effects for chickpeas, whereas extrusion was most effective in peas. Phytosterols present in chickpea, along with other factors (e.g. isoflavones, oligosaccharides), reduce LDL-C levels in the blood by inhibiting the intestinal absorption of cholesterol due to the similarity in their chemical structure with cholesterol, thereby potentially reducing the risk of CHD(Reference Wood, Grusak, Yadav, Redden, Chen and Sharma9,Reference Pittaway, Ahuja and Robertson109).
Diabetes and blood pressure
Pulses such as chickpea have a higher amount of resistant starch and amylose(Reference Pittaway, Ahuja and Robertson109). Amylose has a higher degree of polymerisation (1667 glucosev. 540), rendering the starch in chickpea more resistant to digestion in the small intestine which ultimately results in the lower availability of glucose(Reference Pittaway, Ahuja and Robertson109,Reference Muir and O'Dea138). The lower bioavailability of glucose results in the slower entry of glucose into the bloodstream, thus reducing the demand for insulin which results in the lowering of the GI and insulinaemic postprandial response(Reference Kendall, Emam and Augustin139,Reference Osorio-Díaz, Agama-Acevedo and Mendoza-Vinalay140). The lowering of the GI is an important aspect in reducing both the incidence and the severity of type 2 diabetes(Reference Regina, Bird and Topping141). Further, increased consumption of resistant starch is related to improved glucose tolerance and insulin sensitivity(Reference James, Muir and Curtis102,Reference Tharanathan and Mahadevamma142,Reference Jenkins, Kendall and Augustin143). LA, a PUFA, is biologically important due to its involvement in the production of PG. PG are involved in the lowering of blood pressure and smooth muscle constriction(Reference Aurand, Woods and Wells144). Also, LA and linolenic acid are required for growth and performing different physiological functions(Reference Pugalenthi, Vadivel and Gurumoorthi145). Additionally, phytosterols, such as β-sitosterol, are helpful in reducing blood pressure(Reference Ling and Jones126–Reference Moreau, Whitaker and Hicks128). LA and β-sitosterol are the major PUFA and phytosterol, respectively, in chickpea seeds; therefore, chickpea seeds could be incorporated as part of a regular diet that may help to reduce blood pressure.
Inclusion of chickpea in a high-fat rodent feed reduced the deposition of visceral and ecotopic fats, resulting in hypolipidaemia and insulin-sensitising effects in rats(Reference Yang, Zhou and Gu136). Incorporation of chickpeas in a human study also led to improvements in fasting insulin and total cholesterol content(Reference Pittaway, Robertson and Ball146). Total cholesterol and fasting insulin were reduced by 7·7 mg/dl and 5·2 pmol/l, respectively. In this study, forty-five healthy individuals were fed with a minimum of 104 g chickpea/d for 12 weeks as part of their regular diet.
Cancer
Butyrate is a principal SCFA (about 18 % of the total volatile fatty acids) produced from the consumption of a chickpea diet (200 g/d) in healthy adults(Reference Fernando, Hill and Zello147). Butyrate has been reported to suppress cell proliferation(Reference Cummings, Stephen, Branch, Bruce, Correa, Lipkin, Tannenbaum and Wilkins148)and induce apoptosis(Reference Mathers149), which may reduce the risk of colorectal cancer. Butyrate inhibits histone deacetylase, which prevents DNA compaction and induces gene expression. It has also been suggested that butyrate shunts the cells along the irreversible pathway of maturation leading to cell death(Reference Mathers149). Inclusion of β-sitosterol (the major phytosterol in chickpea;Table 7) in a rat diet reducedN-methyl-N-nitrosourea (carcinogen)-induced colonic tumours(Reference Raicht, Cohen and Fazzini150). Saponin-rich foods have been shown to inhibit pre-neoplastic lesions caused by azoxymethane in the rat colon(Reference Koratkar and Rao151). Protease inhibitors are also known to suppress carcinogenesis by different mechanisms, but their precise targets are still unknown(Reference Duranti and Gius83,Reference Moy and Bilings152,Reference Kennedy153).
Lycopene, an oxygenated carotenoid present in chickpea seeds, may reduce the risk of prostate cancer(Reference Giovannucci, Ascherio and Rimm154). Though there are association studies suggesting a role for lycopene in protection against prostate cancer, the results from very few RCT conducted are not sufficient either to support or refute the role of lycopene in cancer prevention(Reference Konijeti, Henning and Moro155,Reference Ilic, Forbes and Hassed156). Ziegler(Reference Ziegler157)reported that lower levels of carotenoids either in the diet or body can enhance the risk of certain types of cancer. Studies have shown a direct positive correlation between a carotenoid-rich diet and a decreased incidence of lung and other forms of cancer(Reference Bendich158). The cancer prevention ability of carotenoids could be due to their antioxidant properties(Reference Seis, Stahl and Sundquist159), but the exact mode of action needs to be identified.
Biochanin A, a chickpea isoflavone, inhibits the growth of stomach cancer cellsin vitroand reduces tumour growth when the same cells are transferred to mice(Reference Dixon79,Reference Yanagihara, Ito and Toge160). Further, chickpea isoflavone extract specifically inhibited epithelial tumour growth and had no effect on healthy cells(Reference Girón-Calle, Vioque and del Mar Yust161). Murilloet al.(Reference Murillo, Choi and Pan162)have shown a 64 % suppression of azoxymethane-induced aberrant cryptic foci in rats fed with 10 % chickpea flour, and indicated that saponins could be one of the factors for the reduction of lesions.N-Nitrosodiethylamine, a nitrosoamine, has been reported to cause carcinogenesis through DNA mutation(Reference Mittal, Vadhera and Brar163). Inclusion of chickpea seed coat fibre in the diet has been shown to reduce the toxic effects ofN-nitrosodiethylamine on lipid peroxidation and antioxidant potential(Reference Mittal, Vadhera and Brar163). The average percentage decrease in lipid peroxidation was about 21 % in the liver and lungs, about 15·50 % in the spleen and kidney and about 12·46 % in the heart. In eighteen rats divided into three groups of six each, a hypercholesterolaemic diet was fed for 4 weeks: group I was fed a control hypercholesterolaemic diet (starch (63 %), oil (10 %), casein (15 %), cellulose (5 %), salt mixture (5 %), yeast powder (1 %) and cholesterol (1 %)); group II fed a hypercholesterolaemic diet plusN-nitrosodiethylamine (100 mg/kg); group III fed a group II diet+5 % chickpea seed coat fibre.
Weight loss/obesity
Intake of foods, which are rich in DF, is associated with a lower BMI(Reference Howarth, Saltzman and Roberts164,Reference Pereira and Ludwig165). Eating of foods with a high fibre content helps in reaching satiety faster (fullness post-meal), and this satiating effect lasts longer as fibre-rich foods require a longer time to chew and digest in the intestinal system(Reference Marlett, McBurney and Slavin103,Reference Burley, Paul and Blundell166). Additionally, consumption of low-GI foods resulted in an increase in cholecystokinin (a gastrointestinal peptide and hunger suppressant) and increased satiety(Reference Swinburn, Caterson and Seidell167–Reference Holt, Brand and Soveny169). Diets with low-GI foods resulted in reduced insulin levels and higher weight loss compared with those with higher-GI foods(Reference Slabber, Barnard and Kuyl170). Since chickpea is considered to be a low-GI food, it may help in weight-loss and obesity reduction.
Chickpea supplementation in the diet prevented increased body weight and the weight of epididymal adipose tissues in rats(Reference Yang, Zhou and Gu136). At the end of the 8-month experimental period, rats fed on a HFD weighed 654 gv. those fed with a HFD plus chickpea (562 g). The epididymal fat pad weight:total body weight ratio was higher in rats fed on a HFD (0·032 g/g) compared with those fed on a HFD plus chickpea diet (0·023 g/g; details of this experiment are explained in the ‘CVD, CHD and cholesterol control’ section)(Reference Yang, Zhou and Gu136). Therefore, chickpea being a low-GI food could be an effective choice in weight-loss programmes. Chickpea has been reported to decrease fat accumulation in obese subjects. This aids in improving fat metabolism and could be helpful in correcting obesity-related disorders(Reference Yang, Zhou and Gu136). Chickpea supplementation in the diet resulted in increased satiation and fullness(Reference Murty, Pittaway and Ball171). In this study, forty-two participants consumed a chickpea-supplemented diet (average 104 g/d) for 12 weeks; this was preceded and succeeded by their habitual diet for 4 weeks each.
Gut health and laxation
A significant increase (18 %) in DF intake was recorded when 140 g/d of chickpea and chickpea flour were consumed by nineteen healthy individuals for 6 weeks(Reference Nestel, Cehun and Chronopoulos172). Similarly, Murtyet al.(Reference Murty, Pittaway and Ball171)reported a 15 % increase in DF intake in forty-two volunteers (age 52·17 (sd6·30) years old). These studies revealed an overall improvement in bowel health accompanied by an increased frequency of defecation, ease of defecation and softer stool consistency while on a chickpea diet compared with a habitual diet. DF promote laxation/bowel function by aiding in the movement of material through the digestive system.
Other health benefits
Chickpea seed oil contains different sterols, tocopherols and tocotrienols(Reference Akihisa, Yasukawa and Yamaura173–Reference Akihisa, Nishismura and Nakamura175). These phytosterols have been reported to exhibit anti-ulcerative, anti-bacterial, anti-fungal, anti-tumour and anti-inflammatory properties coupled with a lowering effect on cholesterol levels(Reference Murty, Pittaway and Ball171,Reference Arisawa, Kinghorn and Cordell176). Δ7-Avenasterol and Δ5-avenasterol, phytosterols present in chickpea oil, have antioxidant properties even at frying temperatures(Reference Wang, Hicks and Moreau177). Carotenoids such as lutein and zeaxanthin, the major carotenoids in chickpea seeds, are speculated to play a role in senile or age-related macular degeneration. Though there are some epidemiological and association studies suggesting a beneficial effect of lutein and zeaxanthin on age-related macular degeneration, evidence from RCT on the effect of carotenoids on age-related macular degeneration is not presently available(Reference Mozaffarieh, Sacu and Wedrich178). Carotenoids have been reported to increase natural killer cell activity(Reference Santos, Leka and Ribaya179). Vitamin A, a derivative of β-carotene, is important in several developmental processes in humans such as bone growth, cell division/differentiation and, most importantly, vision. It has been reported that at least three million children develop xerophthalmia (damage to cornea) and about 250 000–500 000 children become blind due to vitamin A deficiency(Reference Reifen180). Chickpea has been reported to have higher levels of carotenoids (explained above) than ‘golden rice’, and it could be potentially used as a source of dietary carotenoids.
Chickpea seeds have been used in traditional medicine as tonics, stimulants and aphrodisiacs(Reference Pandey and Enumeratio181). Further, they are used to expel parasitic worms from the body (anthelmintic property), as appetizers, for thirst quenching and reducing burning sensation in the stomach(Reference Zia-Ul-Haq, Iqbal and Ahmad35). In the Ayurvedic system of medicine, chickpea preparations are used to treat a variety of ailments such as throat problems, blood disorders, bronchitis, skin diseases and liver- or gall bladder-related problems (biliousness)(Reference Sastry and Kavathekar182). In addition to these applications, chickpea seeds are also used for blood enrichment, treating skin ailments, ear infections, and liver and spleen disorders(Reference Warner, Nambiar and Remankutty183). Uygur people of China have used chickpea in herbal medicine for treating hypertension and diabetes for over 2500 years(Reference Li, Jiang and Zhang184–Reference Zhang, Jiang and Wang186).
Conclusions
The information presented in this review shows the potential nutritional importance of chickpea and its role in improved nutrition and health. It is an affordable source of protein, carbohydrates, minerals and vitamins, DF, folate, β-carotene and health-promoting fatty acids. Scientific studies have provided some evidence to support the potential beneficial effects of chickpea components in lowering the risk of various chronic diseases, although information pertaining to the role of individual chickpea components in disease prevention and the mechanisms of action are limited to date. This is due to the complex nature of disease aetiology and various factors having an impact on their occurrence. It is imperative that the scientific community continues to unravel the mechanisms involved in disease prevention and determine how food bioactives from foods such as chickpea can influence human health. Further research, especially well-conducted RCT, needs to be performed to provide compelling evidence for the direct health benefits of chickpea consumption.

At Pomona, diversity is crucial to our educational mission. Students enter with widely divergent backgrounds and experiences. Our 1,777 students come from all 50 states (as well as the District of Columbia, Guam, the Northern Mariana Islands and Puerto Rico) and more than 60 countries outside of the United States. Over half identify as domestic students of color and more than 18% are in the first generation of their family to attend a four-year college or university. Students at Pomona engage with, and learn from, peers, faculty, staff and community members whose identities and perspectives may differ considerably from–and even challenge–theirs. This complex intersection of identities and perspectives enriches the larger academic and social communities at Pomona

VetLink
We partnered with select colleges and universities
About VetLink
Service to School has partnered with select colleges and universities to form VetLink, a network of schools committed to expanding access and opportunity for student veterans.  Our partner colleges are widely known for academic excellence, aspiring students, leading-edge research, and high graduation rates.
Service to School works with our partner colleges to create awareness of how a veteran’s military service has prepared them for success in academia. This one-of-a-kind collaboration between Service to School and our partner colleges unifies the respective strengths of each to serve student veterans more effectively than either could alone.
Read MoreAside from Service to School’s normal mentorship service, students are encouraged to use their VetLink program. Service to School VetLink applicants not only work one on one with a mentor, but they also work with a S2S staff member who guides them throughout the entire application process, and directly connects them with the admissions teams at their partner universities. This enables the student to better prepare their application, and each school receives supplemental information on the veteran student which highly increases the student’s chance of being accepted.

Neuroscience is the interdisciplinary study of the nervous system and its relationship to mental processes and behavior.
Department News
Neuroscience has led to new ways of thinking about the nature of human behavior, the mind-brain basis of health and disease, and technologic innovations. At the heart of this interdisciplinary field are the traditional disciplines of biology, psychology and chemistry.
Neuroscientists explore such issues as:
the molecular and cellular basis of neuronal function,
nervous system structure,
how systems of neurons process information,
the way in which information is represented in the brain,
the evolutionary development of the nervous system,
neural correlates of experience and behavior,
and biological mechanisms of nervous system disorders.
At Pomona, our majors have the unique opportunity to learn the fundamentals of neuroscience, perform experimental techniques in state-of-the-art teaching laboratories, and discover how neuroscience provides insight into other liberal arts disciplines, including psychology, economics, computer science and philosophy.
Pomona’s Neuroscience Department is a tight-knit community, supporting student exploration into diverse areas of neuroscience. These areas include:
cell and molecular neuroscience;
systems-level neuroscience;
nervous system disorders such as anxiety and depression;
neuroscientific models of social behavior and interaction;
and imaging the mind at work.
Majors have the opportunity to assist faculty in research or conduct their own project through the Summer Undergraduate Research Program.
The major prepares students for a diverse array of career options, while giving students access to an extensive alumni network of scientists and researchers around the globe.

Statement of Solidarity
Our Commitment to Anti-racism
The Biology Department, which offers both a major and minor, educates students in a range of biological principles, practices, and subject areas.
Our curriculum gives students a broad background in biology while allowing for specialization in fields including environmental, organismal, plant, molecular and cell biology.
The Biology faculty believes strongly in the value of learning not just what is known about biology, but how biologists acquire that knowledge.
To that end, most courses include laboratories in which students gain first-hand experience with the processes of biological inquiry. The emphasis on learning to think scientifically is reflected in the senior exercise, in which each student develops an original biological investigation of a problem.
The Biology faculty also encourages students to participate in biological research on campus. Located in the Richard C. Seaver Building, an innovative LEED-certified building, and the Seaver South Building, the Biology Department’s facilities include controlled environment greenhouses and laboratories equipped with advanced instrumentation.
For field studies, the Claremont College’s local Bernard Biological Field Station includes several natural habitats that serve research and courses in ecology, evolutionary biology, organismal biology, and animal behavior. The department also uses the Pomona College-owned Herman Garner Ecological Preserve in Claremont and the Mildred Pitt Ranch in Monterey County.
For students who want to combine the study of biology with another discipline, there are four interdisciplinary majors: molecular biology, neuroscience, environmental analysis, and public policy analysis in biology.

IRA Qualified Charitable Distributions
IRA Qualified Charitable Distributions
IRA Qualified Charitable Distribution (QCD)
How and Why to Use Your IRA to Make Gifts to Pomona
Did You Know?
IRA Gift Annuity:Congress recently passed the Secure 2.0 Act of 2022, which allows a one-time transfer of up to $53,000 directly from an IRA to fund a charitable gift annuity.
Learn More — New IRA Gift Annuity

The IRA Qualified Charitable Distribution (formerly known as “charitable rollover”) provides an excellent opportunity to make gifts to Pomona College without incurring income taxes today or estate tax in the future. With the passage of the Secure 2.0 Act of 2022, there are now two types of Qualified Charitable Distributions: the original which is an outright gift, and the new version for a Qualified Charitable Distribution to fund a life-income gift similar to a gift annuity.
The Pomona Plan Now Offers IRA Gift Annuities

How
You must be age 70½ or older on the date of the gift.
Transfers must be made directly from a traditional or Roth IRA account by your IRA administrator to Pomona College.Funds that are withdrawn by you and then contributed do not qualify.Gifts from 401k, 403b, SEP and other plans do not qualify.
Funds that are withdrawn by you and then contributed do not qualify.
Gifts from 401k, 403b, SEP and other plans do not qualify.
Gifts must be outright.A QCD can be used to satisfy a pledge or for donor-designated use.
A QCD can be used to satisfy a pledge or for donor-designated use.
Why
IRA Qualified Charitable Distributions:
Can total up to $105,000 per year.Each spouse may make an IRA QCD of $105,000 per year from his or her own IRA.The College can receive a distribution directly from an IRA in an amount greater than $105,000, but the excess over $105,000 will be treated as a taxable distribution to the donor.  An offsetting charitable deduction for the excess may be available depending on your circumstances.Any amount used for the IRA life income QCD may count toward this $105K in a given year
Each spouse may make an IRA QCD of $105,000 per year from his or her own IRA.
The College can receive a distribution directly from an IRA in an amount greater than $105,000, but the excess over $105,000 will be treated as a taxable distribution to the donor.  An offsetting charitable deduction for the excess may be available depending on your circumstances.
Any amount used for the IRA life income QCD may count toward this $105K in a given year
Are not included in your adjusted gross income for federal income tax purposes on your IRS Form 1040 (no charitable deduction is available, however).
Count towards any required minimum distribution for the year from your IRA, if applicable.
Once your required minimum distributions (RMDs) begin, as you plan for your RMDs for the year, consider using those funds for your annual fund, capital gift or life-income QCD to Pomona using the IRA Qualified Charitable Distribution.
Example
Suppose Cecil has $500,000 in an IRA and he wants to contribute $50,000 to Pomona College in honor of his 50th reunion. He can instruct the administrator of his IRA to transfer $50,000 directly to Pomona College as a QCD, and the amount distributed to Pomona will not be subject to federal tax and will be counted toward any annual required minimum distribution he may have. He could also donate $25,000 from this IRA this year and another $25,000 next year, for a total of $50,000. Again, those amounts will satisfy any annual required minimum distributions he may have for the year in which the QCD is received and will not be subject to federal tax.
Frequently Asked Questions
The Protecting Americans from Tax Hikes Act of 2015 permanently extended the IRA Qualified Charitable Distribution to allow individuals age 70½ and older to make direct transfers totaling up to $105,000 per year to 501(c)(3) public charities, without having to count the transfers as income for federal income tax purposes.
Who qualifies?
Individuals who are age 70½ or older on the date of the gift.
How much can I transfer?
$105,000 per year. Each spouse may make an IRA QCD of $105,000 per year from his or her own IRA.
From what accounts can I make transfers?
Transfers must come from your traditional or Roth IRA directly to Pomona. If you have retirement assets in 401k, 403b or other retirement accounts, you may roll those funds into an IRA, and then direct the IRA administrator to transfer the funds from the IRA directly to Pomona. Note, however, that you will need to satisfy any remaining required minimum distribution from the retirement account before rolling over to the IRA, so this option may work best for an IRA QCD planned for the next calendar year.
To what charities can I make gifts?
Pomona College and other qualified public charities under Section 170(b)(1)(A) of the Internal Revenue Code, to which deductible contributions can be made.
Can I use the IRA Qualified Charitable Distribution to fund life-income gifts (charitable gift annuities or charitable remainder trusts), donor advised funds or supporting organizations?
The IRA Qualified Charitable Distribution may be used to fund life-income gifts but is not eligible to fund donor-advised funds or supporting organizations under current law.
Can I use the IRA Qualified Charitable Distribution to support a particular purpose, like financial aid?
Yes, IRA Qualified Charitable Distributions can be designated to support important needs of the College in the same way as other outright gifts.
How will Pomona College count the gift?
We will give you full credit for the entire gift, the same as other outright gifts.
What are the tax implications to me?
Federal — You do not recognize taxable income on the transfer to Pomona College, provided the funds go directly from the IRA administrator to the College. However, you are not entitled to an income tax charitable deduction for your QCD gift.
State — Each state has different laws, so you will need to consult with your own tax advisor. Some states have a state income tax and will include this transfer as income. Within those states, some will allow for a state income tax charitable deduction and others will not. Other states base their state income tax on the federal adjusted gross income or federal tax paid. Still other states have no income tax at all.
Does this transfer qualify as my required minimum distribution (RMD)?
Yes. For those who turn 73 in 2023 or later, required minimum distributions (RMDs) from IRAs begin at age 73. For those who turned 72 in 2022 or earlier, RMDs have already begun. Once RMDs begin, you are required to take minimum distributions from your retirement plans each year, according to a federal formula. IRA QCDs count towards your IRA RMD for the year.
Can my spouse also make an IRA Qualified Charitable Distribution, even if we are married and file jointly?
Yes, every individual can use the IRA Qualified Charitable Distribution for up to $105,000 each year.
How do I know if an IRA Qualified Charitable Distribution is right for me?
You are at least age 70½, and:
You have RMDs and do not need the additional income from the distribution, or
Your charitable gifts already exceed the relevant annual cap (based on a percentage of adjusted gross income), so you do not benefit from an income tax charitable deduction for additional gifts, or
You do not itemize deductions.
What is the procedure to execute an IRA Qualified Charitable Distribution?
Your IRA administrator may have its own form to initiate a Qualified Charitable Distribution, and, if so, it is best to use the custodian’s form. If your provider does not have its own form, we have a sample letter that you can prepare and send to your IRA administrator to initiate a QCD.
Please call us toll free at (909) 607-6096 when you initiate the QCD so we can look for the check from your IRA administrator and issue the appropriate receipt.
Can IRA Qualified Charitable Distributions be deducted as charitable gifts?
No, but IRA Qualified Charitable Distributions are as valuable as deductible contributions because they are not subject to income tax, so no deduction is needed.
If the gift cannot be deducted, why would I want to take advantage of the opportunity?
Many donors view the IRA Qualified Charitable Distribution as a way to manage their taxable income. The amount of the qualified IRA Qualified Charitable Distribution is excluded from income and can lower your Adjusted Gross Income (“AGI”) to:
Save you from owing higher taxes on Social Security benefits and paying higher Medicare premiums; and
Make you less likely to be subject to the 3.8% tax on net investment income.
Are there advantages with regard to Adjusted Gross Income (AGI)?
Yes. Since charitable deductions are limited by AGI, the IRA Qualified Charitable Distribution allows donors to maximize charitable contributions while minimizing AGI. And the IRA Qualified Charitable Distribution may allow especially generous donors to benefit from contributions beyond their AGI limits.
I take the standard deduction, instead of itemizing, so I cannot deduct charitable donations.  Does the IRA Qualified Charitable Distribution help me?
Yes! Since the IRA Qualified Charitable Distribution counts toward any RMD you may have and is not subject to tax, your benefit is equivalent to an income tax deduction even if you do not itemize your deductions.
If you have questions about the tax implications of IRA Qualified Charitable Distributions,please contact us.

Delivering Lifetime Income for More Than 75 Years...
For more than 75 years, the Pomona Plan has set a high standard for excellence and integrity in life-income agreements. During those years, it has served generations of individuals and families seeking to secure their own financial futures while also supporting the education of tomorrow’s leaders.
Participants in the Pomona Plan benefit from our long, accomplished history in managing life-income agreements. A pioneering institution in this area, Pomona issued its first charitable annuity in 1892 and developed the Pomona Plan in the 1940s. Today, it still sets the standard of planned giving programs among its peer institutions. This website provides information about the financial instruments offered under the Pomona Plan.

Stories of Sagehen Impact
Meet the 2024-2025 Pomona College Alumni Association Board and Get to Know New President Andrea Venezia ’91
Meet the 2024-2025 Pomona College Alumni Association Board and Get to Know New President Andrea Venezia ’91
Seaver House, the campus home of Pomona College alumni.
Alumni Association Board President Andrea Venezia ’91
Venezia and her mentor Prof. Bob Herman ’51.
2024-2025 Pomona College Alumni Association Board
Every other month, theAlumni Association Boardgathers in Zoom meetings (and in person twice a year on campus) to get down to business about connecting alumni with each other and Pomona. Serving as a liaison between the College and alumni community, the board leads and supports a number of programs, events and initiatives throughout the year, including Pomona College Regional Alumni Chapters and Alumni Weekend and Reunion Celebrations. They are a highly engaged group of Pomona alumni volunteers with a diverse range of backgrounds, experiences and professions. Members commit to three-year terms and currently span every decade of Pomona grads beginning with the 1980s. The president of the board serves a two-year term. Each academic year sees a handful of members rolling off and new members beginning their terms. This year’s board leadership and members are:
Andrea Venezia ’91 (Alumni Association Board President), Stuart Friedel ’08 (Co-chair, Regional Chapters Committee), Emily Zheng ’19 (Co-chair, Regional Chapters Committee), Josh Rodriguez ’13 (Chair, Engagement Committee), Robi Ganguly ’00 (Co-chair, Development Committee), Nina Zhou '19 (Co-chair, Development Committee), Soren Austenfeld ’15, Eliza Bennitt ’98, Michael Bright ’10, Lauren Clarke ’83 P’18, Miguel Delgado ’20, Renee Dupont ’80 P’09 P’14, Anne Elsberry ’91 P’14, Robi Ganguly ’00, Anthony "Tony" King ’97, Toran Langford ’21, Linda Luisi ’81, Te’auna Patterson ’18, Tricia Sipowicz ’85 P’22, Jim Sutton ’84 P’22, James Zhang ’95
Alumni Association Board President Andrea Venezia ’91 is kicking off her first of two years as president this fall, after three years as a board member. As a student, Venezia was a member of the Presidential Search Committee that helped bring President Emeritus Peter Stanley to Pomona, an experience she says sparked a passion for higher education leadership that has lasted decades. Venezia’s involvement with the Alumni Board is highly motivated by Pomona community building and relationships. Read on to learn more about what drives her dedication to Pomona.
What led you to the Alumni Association Board?
After the first year of the pandemic, I felt pretty isolated and wanted to connect more with people. I was also concerned about how students were experiencing college during that time. So, I applied to be on the Alumni Board, wanting to find a way to help support Pomona communities. My career has focused on equitable access to, and success in, college—with a lens on structural inequities in public education. Becoming a member of the Alumni Board seemed like a cool opportunity to focus that lens on supporting Pomona in this unusual moment in time, given the toll the pandemic took on higher education.
What is your vision for your two-year term as president?
I’d like for the board to continue as a connecting force among the alumni community to strengthen and build relationships through opportunities like regional chapter events, career-focused programs, discussions with faculty and book club. And with the board on campus to help with Alumni Weekend each year, it’s a unique moment for members to meet and talk with hundreds of alumni face-to-face, and with students. Part of my vision is growing the board’s connection with the College from the perspective that students will be alumni longer than they will be students.
What is the Alumni Board focusing on this year?
We’ll focus on a few areas working through our three main committees: Engagement, Regional Chapters and Development. All three center on relationships first and foremost. The Engagement Committee focuses on events, such as career panels and Alumni Weekend planning and support. The Regional Chapters Committee will aid the fantastic work the regional chapters do nationally to bring Pomona people together. And the Development Committee will work on fundraising efforts, while also focusing on community connection—like inviting Pomona seniors to an Alumni Weekend event. As a board, we believe that giving back to the College financially is an indicator of how connected people feel to Pomona, so we pour our energies into building relationships first and foremost.
What is your approach to fostering a sense of community and strengthening alumni engagement within the board and the College?
It’s important for people to see themselves in the board and in our programming. I’ve done a fair amount of work around equity-driven leadership and facilitation and consider that when I think about leading a diverse, multi-generational board. I want to create space for everyone to be seen and heard. As an English major at Pomona, I learned a lot about subtext that I carry into work like this. I think so much of what’s needed now is to truly listen to people, reflect on what we learn from each other, find common ground when possible and take action to make something better.
As someone who has supported Pomona with your time, expertise and donations, why is it important for alumni to get involved and give back?
Venezia with her parents at Commencement.
For me, getting involved is a wonderful way to get to know students, learn more about what Pomona is like now, and get to know different generations of alumni. It feels good to give back to an institution that gave so much to me, and to be with others who feel similarly. Mostly, though, I hope that new generations of alumni feel the same sense of connectedness and community that I experienced at Pomona—which brings me back to my vision of the board helping to support community building.
What effect did your Pomona experience have on your life and career?
I was incredibly lucky to have the late sociology professor Bob Herman ‘51 and his wife, Carol, take me under their wings. His mentorship heavily influenced me when I was a professor at California State University, Sacramento. I sought to build the same kind of culture of care in a large institution that I experienced at Pomona. Lee Harlan ‘55 and Nancy Treser-Osgood ‘80 in the alumni office at Seaver House also showed me what wonderful connections staff could forge with students—I’m still in touch with Nancy and Carol Herman.
Do you have a favorite Pomona memory?
Venezia with friends during college.
I loved hanging out with friends at the Wash, getting late night fries and milkshakes at the Coop and playing soccer. Academically, taking Shakespeare from Martha Andresen and a Geology class that was co-taught by her and Donald McIntyre stand out as major highlights when I was a student.
What piece of advice do you have for current Pomona students?
My advice is to take some classes that fill your soul and surprise you, that diverge a bit from what you might have expected you’d take. And spend time with your friends. The relationships you’ll build at Pomona last a lifetime.

Leave a Lasting Legacy of Support for Pomona
The generosity and collective foresight of alumni, faculty, staff, family and friends who have included Pomona in their estate plans help ensure that the College remains at the forefront of liberal arts education.  You can also impact future generations of Pomona students, faculty, and staff in this way by including a legacy gift for Pomona in your estate plan.
This website describes the many ways you can leave a legacy gift that gives back to Pomona, and pays it forward, setting an example for future generations.  Thoughtful estate planning can help you meet financial and familial goals, while maximizing your philanthropic impact.  We invite you to explore the options described here and to call us with questions or to start a conversation.
Getting Started
There are many planned gifts that won’t affect your existing financial resources, but will have a significant impact on Pomona College. Give to the institution you care so much about, while maintaining control and flexibility.
Learn How You Can Give »
Make a Bequest
A bequest is a gift provision in your will or revocable living trust. All assets, including cash, securities, real estate, and tangible personal property, may be transferred to Pomona College at the end of your life.
Learn About Bequests »Bequest Language for Donors »
The Ideal Gift for You?
When determining the right gift option, it’s vital to first decide your most important personal and family goal. This could range from maximizing tax benefits to preserving assets for your heirs.
Learn The Best Gift for You »
A Gift of Retirement Assets
A gift of your retirement assets, such as an employee retirement plan, IRA, or tax-sheltered annuity, is an excellent way to make an outright or legacy gift. A gift of these assets can shield your heirs from taxes while funding Pomona's future.

Shelter or Evacuate?
Shelter in Place or Evacuate?
The College is committed to getting accurate emergency alerts and information to members of the community as soon as possible. However, in the first minutes of an emergency, you may need to make an immediate decision to “shelter in place” or move to a safer location. You should understand and plan for both possibilities. Use common sense and available information, including what you are learning here, to determine if there is immediate danger.
Whether you are at home, work or elsewhere, there may be situations when it’s best to stay where you are and avoid any rapidly changing or unknown situation outside. There are other circumstances when staying put and creating a barrier between yourself and potential danger is a matter of survival. Use available information to assess the situation.
Shelter in Place or Lockdown?
Depending on the circumstances, when the College issues a campus alert calling for a lockdown or to shelter in place, you should:
Move into or stay inside the nearest building.
Go into an interior room or office with few windows, if possible.
Secure or block doors.
Silence all electronics; set phones to vibrate.
If the door has a window, cover it.
Stay away from windows and doors.
If you can, take your emergency supply kit with you, unless you have reason to believe it has been contaminated.
Remain in place until notified by proper College administration officials (D.A.R.T.  member for your building or the College Emergency Reponse Team).
Evacuation
There may be situations when you need to evacuate quickly to ensure your safety. Please do so and alert others in your area if possible. If it is safe to do so, go to your building’sdesignated evacuation site. If the evacuation site does not appear to be safe, get to a safe place as soon as possible.
In either case, if there has been no emergency alert from the College or Campus Safety, please contact Campus Safety at (909) 607-2000 as soon as possible. They will send an alert to the community and provide information to the Pomona College Emergency Response Team.
In situations when you are ordered to leave an area, be sure to take necessary items such as keys, glasses and wallets. You may not be able to return to your dorm room, office or classroom for some time. It is best to be prepared.

Everbridge Mass Notification
Everbridge Mass Notification is an emergency notification service that enables Campus Safety to notify you quickly about a major emergency on campus and to provide you with information and instructions. Messages are sent via email, text and recorded message to campus phone extensions. Students, faculty and staff with a campus phone extension and college email are already in the Everbridge database. To add a cell phone number and/or home number, log on to the campus portal atmy.pomona.eduand click on the Everbridge link. All contact information included in Everbridge will be used ONLY for campus emergency notification and will NOT be made available to any other service.
LiveSafe
LiveSafe is a free app that improves communication between students, faculty, staff and campus police and allows for faster emergency response in distress situations. By having access to the latest safety information, our goal is to help build a safe campus, together. The app allows students, faculty and staff to:
Report tips anonymously to campus safety.
Let friends or family monitor you as you walk home, so you have to walk alone.
Receive real-time safety alerts from campus police to your phone.
Here's how you can get the app:
Visit the iTunes or Google Play store depending on your smartphone and download the "LiveSafe" app (blue shield icon).
Choose "Pomona College" from the list of schools that appears once you've downloaded.
Fill in your emergency name and contact info so we can get in touch in the event of an emergency.
Campus Public Alert System
Pomona College has 49 emergency alert broadcast stations located throughout the campus that can be used as a public address system. In an emergency, they will be used to broadcast warning tones and short messages. The stations with emergency phones, which are topped by blue lights, can also connect a user directly to Campus Safety when the red button is pushed.
Emergency Website

Emergency Preparation
LiveSafe is a free personal safety mobile application for students, staff, faculty, and the community to engage in two-way conversation with Campus Safety.
Pomona College is prepared to respond to emergencies 24 hours per day, 7 days per week. If a major emergency occurs, the Executive Staff and the Emergency Response Team will direct the College’s emergency response. Specially trained response and support teams will be activated. These include community care, medical, and search and rescue teams.
The College’s highest priority is the safety and well-being of the community’s students, faculty and staff. To this end, Pomona College has developed a comprehensiveEmergency Management Plan, regularly trains for various emergencies, and holds regular emergency and evacuation drills.
You can help ensure that the College community is as prepared as possible by being familiar with the information on this website, making sure that your contact information (phone number and email) is up-to-date inEverbridgeand participating in all College emergency drills. You should also assemble a small personal “go bag,” which could include extra glasses, contact lens solution, any necessary medication, and list of emergency family phone numbers.
In the event of an emergency situation, emergency alerts will be relayed to the Pomona College community as quickly as possible through Everbridge, the Campus Public Alert System and the College’s emergency websites. Updates and directions will be provided as information becomes available through Everbridge and the emergency websites.
Adequate planning saves lives and reduces suffering, by enabling individuals to respond calmly and effectively in emergency situations.

Frequently Asked Questions
Language Tables Frequently Asked Questions

General
What are language tables?
Language tables provide a low-stakes environment to converse in a particular language at tables mentored by Language Residents and other native or advanced speakers. They take place in the Oldenborg dining hall over lunch.
Why is there a No-English policy at languages tables?
The No-English policy allows Oldenborg to create an immersive language learning environment, which is integral for advancing language skills and offers the best preparation for times when one might need to use the language in a real-life situation (i.e. study abroad).
Given our day to day lives take place primarily in English, immersion in a language you are looking to improve can be an invaluable gift.
Language tables sound intimidating. What if I make a mistake or don’t understand what people are saying?
Making mistakes is an important part of learning a language. We welcome mistakes at Oldenborg! Everyone at tables is learning to some degree and we foster being supportive of one another in this process.
Join us!
But what if I’m a beginner?
As a beginner you may start out doing more listening than speaking, and that’s OK. You might be surprised how much you’ll improve if you participate regularly. Before you know it, you’ll soon be having conversations.
Beginner days are available for Chinese, Japanese, German, Russian, Spanish, and French every Wednesday. We have extra support on these days for those language learners who are just getting started.
Can I learn a new language from zero only by attending tables?
Language tables are not meant to take the place of a class. For complete beginners language tables are a great supplement to formal language instruction.
Is Oldenborg like the other dining halls?
Oldenborg is different than the other dining halls in that it is a co-curricular space for our community to participate in language learning or globally themed events hosted by Oldenborg. Attendees are expected to participate in Oldenborg programs. For regular dining, please visit other dining halls.
Is a meal purchase required to participate in the language tables program?
Yes. Because our program takes place in a dining hall during lunch time, a meal purchase is required for entry and participation.
Students must swipe twice at the front desk. The first swipe is for their meal and the second is for language tables credit.
Please see section below for faculty and staff, and community members.
When and where do language tables take place?
We will continue with our lunch programming for the fall 2024 semester with indoor seating, starting on Tuesday, September 3. All Language tables will occur between 12 p.m. and 1 p.m in the Oldenborg dining hall.
All students, faculty, and staff must enter through the dining hall main door and then proceed to find their language table signaled with the appropriate sign.
Language tables are open whenever classes are in session. The last day of language tables will be Wednesday, December 4.
Where can I find the language table schedule?
To access the schedule, starting September 3, visit theOldenborg website.
When is beginner day?
We have extra support for those language learners who are just getting started. Beginner days are available for Chinese, Japanese, German, Russian, Spanish, and French every Wednesday.
Can I bring my green box to Oldenborg?
As was the practice before the pandemic, no green boxes will be allowed in the dining hall.
For Students
Can 5C students attend Oldenborg language tables?
Language tables are open to all 5C students.
Will I need to pay for a meal when I come to tables?
Yes, a meal purchase is required to participate in the program. All students must "double swipe". The first swipe is for your meal and the second one is for language table credit.
What if I don't have a meal plan?
A meal purchase is required for entry into the Oldenborg dining hall. Oldenborg is able to support 5C students who areenrolled in Pomona language classesand have very limited or no meal plan at all in the following ways:
5C students who have a plan of 8 or fewer meals per week can have their lunch covered by Oldenborg once per week when attending language tables
5C students who don't have a meal plan at all can have their lunch covered by Oldenborg up to two times per week when attending language tables
Students in these circumstances should emailoldenborg@pomona.eduprior to their first visitto have their enrollment and meal plan status verified. We will then provide them with further instructions.
How will my professor know how many tables I’ve attended?
Pomona professors can check language table attendance for their classes in the portal.
For non-Pomona language classes, please ask your professors how they will track attendance. Many professors give out a handout that requires signatures or stamps. Oldenborg staff can provide stamps at the check-in desk.
If you live in Oldenborg, please emailoldenborg@pomona.eduto know your attendance.
Do I need to stay for the whole hour to get credit for attending the tables?
No, but we do ask that you stay for at least 15 minutes. Language learning requires practice, time, and dedication.
Please keep in mind that we only mark attendance once per day regardless of the number of languages you participate in. If you have a language table requirement, make sure to organize your visits throughout the semester.
Faculty/Staff
Can faculty and staff participate in language tables?
Oldenborg encourages 7C faculty and staff to participate in language tables! Whether it’s for improving your own language skills or offering expertise in a language you are fluent in, we hope that you join us.
Remember that first and foremost the program aims to serve students who are learning or practicing a language. Please keep this in mind as you engage with others at the tables.
Also note that language tables are not meant to take the place of a class. For complete beginners, language tables are a great supplement to formal language instruction.
Lastly, we ask that all attendees be respectful of Oldenborg’s no-English policy at language tables. This key feature of the program allows us to maintain an immersive language learning environment, which is integral for advancing language skills and offers the best preparation for times when one might need to use the language in a real-life situation (i.e. study abroad).
Do faculty and staff need to pay for a meal when attending language tables?
Oldenborg welcomes faculty and staff’s active participation at language tables and is pleased to cover the cost of their lunch meal.
Faculty and/or staff who have meal swipes available are welcome to utilize this at Oldenborg.
Community Members
Can local community members attend language tables?
Community members interested in participating in the language tables program should reach out tooldenborg@pomona.edubefore attending.
Admission is at Oldenborg’s discretion and there is a $10 charge per visit.

I love playing Dungeons & Dragons and other tabletop games with my friends.
Tell us when and how you started studying foreign languages and what you like about learning languages.
I started learning English when I was in first grade, so when I was 6 years old. I started learning because my brother, who is 4 years older, needed help studying. That meant when he was studying his English skills with my mother at the dining room table, I learnt with him.
Tell us about a fun project idea that you would like to do in your conversation classes.
I would love to do something culinary, cooking or baking. Probably baking some proper German bread (we are big on bread here) or cooking some traditional dishes, likeCurrywurst PommesandGulasch.
Tell us what you would like to see in California or in the U.S. during your time at the College.
I really want to go to San Francisco and I also want to visit the LACMA. If I have the time (and the money) I’d also really love to go to New York and see a Broadway show.

2024-2025 Academic Year: Manxi Wang
Tell us something special about your hometown.
I was born in Beijing, the capital of China, where there are lots of places of interest like the Great Wall and the Forbidden City. It is a charming place not only because it integrates traditional and modern culture but also because people from all over the world gather here, creating an open and welcoming atmosphere. Living in this international and dynamic city helps me have more chances to make friends and have insight into diverse cultures. I really love this city and welcome all of you to come to Beijing in the future!
What would you like to learn from your students in your classes?
Everyone is unique and has his own experience so there are lots of things I could learn from my students. Maybe it is a new English word, a popular app, wonderful thoughts, admirable attitudes towards different situations and so on. I don’t know what I will learn but I will try my best to find every shining point on them.
Tell us about a favorite activity that you pursue when you have free time.
I really enjoy doing handicrafts in my free time. Whether it is greeting cards, scrapbooks, or Chinese knots, I feel a sense of accomplishment when seeing beautiful things made by myself. In addition, handicrafts contain my love so I am willing to give them to my friends as gifts.

Pomona College complies with Section 504 of the Rehabilitation Act of 1973 as amended, the Americans with Disabilities Act of 1990 as amended, and other applicable state and federal law prohibiting discrimination against individuals with disabilities. We are committed to providing appropriate services and reasonable accommodations for students with disabilities.
Accessibility Resources and Services Mission Statement
Mission Statement
Pomona College is committed to removing barriers and improving accessibility for all members of our campus community. The ARS Office is committed to cultivating an inclusive environment and promoting equal access through reasonable accommodations and services.
Vision
We envision a diverse and accessible campus community that is responsive to the needs of students with disabilities. The ARS Office will continue to develop policies and procedures, provide services, and programming that ensure equal access and opportunity to all aspects of campus life.
Core Values
Accountability
Accountability means being responsible for one’s own actions by listening to feedback, following through on commitments, and understanding the impact of your words and actions on others.
Equity
Equity means seeking full participation and thriving for everyone by recognizing that people do not all start from the same place and working to intentionally address barriers and power imbalances.
Inclusion
Inclusion means respecting the humanity of all people by striving to create an environment where people feel like they belong and are accepted as they are, inclusive of all identities they hold.
Intentionality
Intentionality means acting with purpose and deliberation by aligning your actions with the goals and causes of the communities you serve.
Open-Mindedness
Open-mindedness means being receptive to new ideas by trusting others and actively searching for alternative ways of knowing, acting, and problem-solving.
Guiding Principles
Disability is a valued aspect of human diversity that adds to the spirit of our campus community.
We honor each student’s lived experience and how they choose to identify themselves (e.g., by using person-first vs identity-first language).
We reject ableism and believe that all bodies and minds are valuable.
Disability is an opportunity to innovate, not a burden to accommodate.
Make accessibility a forethought, not an afterthought.
Accessibility is the responsibility of the entire campus community, not simply the ARS Office.
ARS Office services are student-centers and collaborative in nature.
Accessibility Resources and Services (ARS)
This page provides guidance for newly admitted students and current Pomona students with a new disability. You will find information on how to apply, documentation guidelines, online student application, and accommodations offered.
As a current ARS student, you must notify your instructors every semester by submitting your accommodation requests. On this page you will find tutorials, our policies and procedures, as well as answers to frequently asked questions.
Our compliance with federal and state law is a shared responsibility in which faculty play an important role. This page provides information and resources to assist you in creating an accessible learning environment.

Disability Grievance Procedure
Grievance Process
Students and parents/guardians are encouraged to speak to the Director of Accessibility regarding potential accommodations and the required paperwork.
If a student is denied their requested accommodation that they believe is necessary, the student may take their concerns to theDean of Students for Academic and Personal Success. Students should fill out the "Accommodation Reconsideration Form" and include additional information that supports their request. Students may attach additional documentation that addresses the reasons given by ARS for the denial. The Dean will evaluate the matter and make appropriate recommendations within five (5) working days of receiving the additional information. If an agreement cannot be reached, the Senior Associate Dean of Students can review the original request.
Additionally, in the event the student disagrees with the director’s decision the student may pursue the college's formal grievance procedures. Students may take allegations of discrimination to one of the College's grievance officers.  For additional information on the College's grievance procedures, please see the College'sDiscrimination and Harassment Policies and Grievance Procedures.Students are also able to file a grievance with the Office of Civil Rights.
Dr. Adaly Reyes Martinez serves as the college's Director of Accessibility.  She is located in the Dean of Students Office, Pomona College, 550 N. College Ave, Claremont, CA, 91711. Contact information: disability@pomona.edu 909-621-8017.

Symplicity Privacy Program
Privacy at Symplicity

Our Privacy Center provides an overview of our Data Privacy Program and our approach to data privacy. We also have additional helpful data privacy information on the following pages:
ThePrivacy Policydetails how we use personal information.
TheCookie Statementexplains our use of cookies.
TheData Privacy FrameworksPage details which frameworks Symplicity currently supports
TheData Privacy Requestspage details information about how you can make requests
TheSub-Processorspage lists our current list of sub-processors
Symplicity establishes systems and operational requirements that support the achievement of service commitments, relevant laws and regulations, and other security and privacy requirements.Privacy Policies are important because they detail a company’s views and procedures regarding the information collected fromusers.Symplicity takes ourprivacy policies and procedures obligations seriously.Symplicityis the global leader inhigher education student services applications.Leading the way among EdTech companies, we’ve worked with outside privacy counsels all over the world to ensure compliance withmultiple data privacy frameworksin the regionswherewe supporthigher educationinstitutionssuch as the GDPR/UK-GDPR, PIPEDA,CCPA,The Privacy Act, LGPD,PDPA, and more.
You can learn more about Symplicity's privacy practices in ourPrivacy Policy

Our Data Privacy Program & Approach
We care about privacy. We believe that privacy is a fundamental right for all individuals. Our clients entrust us with the personal information of their employees and their users, who are often students. We take the obligations that are attached to this information very seriously.
Data privacy and security have therefore been long-standing key priorities of Symplicity. The European Union General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) was an opportunity to further strengthen our existing data privacy practices and formalize them as part of a global data privacy program led by our Global Privacy Officer.
Our approach to data privacy has always been client-focused. We understand the challenges our clients face. Our Data Privacy Program is designed to help them with their data privacy compliance.

Cookie Policy
We collect information about your visits to the website and the application when you land on any of our web pages through cookies and similar tracking technology.
For further information about the types of cookies we use, you can access our Cookie Policy at this link:https://www.symplicity.com/compliance/privacy/cookie-statement.
Privacy by design
As it becomes more and more challenging in today’s world for individuals to maintain control over their information, privacy by design and accountability become increasingly important to maintain the trust of individuals, clients, and regulators and to document how an organization complies with the GDPR. Privacy by design is therefore at the heart of our Data Privacy Program.
Ability for clients to provide their own privacy policies
Features built within the applications
Access Controls (SAML, SSO, etc.)
Ability for clients to enforce their own data retention policies
Separate databases to prevent co-mingling of data.
Data Protection Officer
Symplicity's Data Protection Officer (DPO) is the main point of contact for the data protection authority, responsible for overseeing the company's data protection strategy and its implementation to ensure compliance with GDPR requirements.

Data transfers
We have a multi-layered approach to data transfer compliance. This means we address data transfer requirements via multiple avenues to ensure personal information is adequately protected:
Regional hosting: We have a regional hosting strategy with all key products and functionalities hosted in regions (e.g. in the EU for EU clients) to the extent possible. Access to personal information from outside the region (e.g. from outside the EEA) to this regionally hosted personal information may be required to provide the products and services, e.g. for 24/7-support and product maintenance.
Standard Contractual Clauses: We use the EU-approved data standard contractual clauses (SCCs) to transfer personal information.
Supplementary measures: We use additional contractual, organizational and technical measures to protect transferred personal information.
Onward transfers: Robust contracts are in place with vendors and partners (e.g. Amazon Web Services) to ensure that data transfer requirements (and other data privacy obligations) are passed on to our vendors and partners with access to personal information.

Data Retention
According to Data Privacy Regulations, Symplicity is typically a data processor.  Most of our clients, mainly schools and universities, are the data controller.  As the data controller, schools and universities can enforce their own data retention policies within their licensed Symplicity Applications.  For our Recruit and CareerHub Central applications, Symplicity takes on the role as the data controller relative to our employer partners' personal information.

Data Privacy Impact Assessment (DPIA)
Symplicity has performed a Data Privacy Impact Assessment (DPIA) on all of our applications and networks.  The DPIA is reviewed and updated annually.

Hosting
Symplicity has a regional hosting strategy.  That means that your data will be stored in the data zone where the application was licensed.  For example, if you licensed your application in the United States, your data will ONLY be stored in the United States.

People
Colin J. Beck
Colin J. Beck


ExpertiseExpertiseColin J. Beck is a political sociologist interested in a classic big question of sociology—how and why do societies and institutions change?

Expertise
Colin J. Beck is a political sociologist interested in a classic big question of sociology—how and why do societies and institutions change? He primarily examines this question through the lens of revolution, as revolutions are times when alternative social orders are imagined, authored and potentially enacted. In particular, his award-winning work on revolutionary waves draws on global-transnational sociology to understand why multiple revolutions occur simultaneously and how they affect each other.
An interest in revolution almost necessarily leads to its contemporary counterparts—terrorism and social movement radicalism. As one of the few sociological experts on multiple forms of political violence, he has examined cases as diverse as radical environmental activism, political Islam, 18th century Enlightenment revolutions, and the Arab Spring.
Beck is the author ofRadicals, Revolutionaries, and Terrorists(2015), a book based on a seminar of the same name that he has taught at Pomona since 2010. He is a member of the International Relations Program in addition to the Department of Sociology, and has held elected positions in the American Sociological Association.

About
What Do We Really Know About Revolution?
My current project is a meta-analysis of five decades of comparative studies of revolution. I first examine the “how” of the field: how cases are selected and compared. I explore the “why” of the resulting demography by considering who produces knowledge about revolution and their connections to each other. I then consider the “what” of the field's true findings: which theories apply to which revolutions, and which causal factors have the most explanatory power across many cases. With thanks toLisa Anne Auerbachfor weaving my bookshelves.
What Do We Really Know About (the Social Science of) Revolution? Networks of Scholars, Cases, and Theories, in progress
On Revolutions
It is time to advance the next generation of revolution studies. We document the shift from "big R" Revolution to "small r" revolutions that target regimes, not states, and have goals for individuals, not societies. The book integrates insights from related fields into the study of revolution and challenges the dichotomies that bedevil revolution studies: social versus political revolutions; structure versus agency; violence versus nonviolence; domestic versus international factors; and success versus failure. We call for greater reflexivity about concepts, methods, and the ethical issues that lie at the intersection of revolutionary theory and practice.
On Revolutions: Unruly Politics in the Contemporary World,Oxford University Press2022, withMlada Bukovansky,Erica Chenoweth,George Lawson,Sharon Erickson Nepstad, andDaniel P. Ritter
Radicals, Revolutionaries, and Terrorists
Social movements, revolutions, and terrorism share similar causes and processes. In my first book, I consider eight key questions for understanding radicalism. Ranging across the globe from the 1500s to the present, diverse cases are examined, e.g., 19th century anarchists, fascists, Che Guevara, the Weather Underground, Chechen insurgents, the Earth Liberation Front, Al-Qaeda, and the Arab Spring. Throughout, I demonstrate how to draw on multiple areas of research to better explain the forms movements take. The book is based on a seminar of the same name I have taught since 2010.
Radicals, Revolutionaries, and Terrorists,Polity2015
Revolutions
My primary area of expertise is revolutions. In my work on revolutionary waves, I find that cultural constructions of the transnational system strain regimes, fracture elites, and empower oppositions as well as make cross-national diffusion more likely. Articles published inTheory and SocietyandSocial Science Historyhave won awards from sections of the American Sociological Association.

Social movements and terrorism
Revolution's contemporary counterparts include radicalism, political violence, and terrorism. I use insights from sociology and social movement theory to explain different aspects of political violence. Currently, I am extending my research on terrorism designations to understand media labeling of militant groups.

The global and transnational
The international human rights regime is the mirror image of radicalism and political violence in the contemporary world. My research explores the dynamics of the international system and domestic politics. Kristen Shorette, John Meyer, Gili Drori, and I currently are investigating human rights in national constitutions.
Constitutions in World Society: A New Measure of Human Rights,Constitution-Making and Transnational Legal Order2019, withJohn W. Meyer,Ralph I. Hosoki, andGili S. Drori
World Influences on Human Rights Language in Constitutions,International Sociology2012, withGili S. DroriandJohn W. Meyer
I am a professor atPomona Collegein Claremont, California, and a faculty affiliate of theInternational Relations Program.
My research lies in the areas of political and global-transnational sociology with quantitative and comparative-historical approaches. I am particularly interested in revolutions. This almost necessarily leads to an interest in revolution's contemporary counterparts—radicalism and terrorism—and their mirror image in international human rights.
At Pomona, I teach courses on social movements, global sociology, research methods, and social theory.

Biography
Mlada Bukovansky’s research focuses on the evolving norms and institutions of the international system. She has written on revolutions and changing conceptions of sovereignty, corruption and anti-corruption regimes, the World Trade Organization and agricultural trade, and U.S. responsibilities in a changing world order. Her current work focuses on international ethics and on the challenges to the liberal international order. She has a longstanding interest in the intersection between the study of history, especially the history of political thought, and that of international relations.

Pre-Professional Preparation
While Pomona College does not offer majors in Prehealth, Pre-Law or Pre-Engineering, we do provide guidance for students interested in these paths.
Information on our Prehealth site outlines the range of health professions (including medical, veterinary, dental, etc.), how to prepare (including which courses to take), how to apply to health profession programs, and how to reach out for one-on-one advising appointments. Our Pre-Law page offers information on resources and advisors whom you can speak with.
Pomona offers two combined Pre-Engineering programs with other universities: the 3-2 Plan in Engineering:California Institute of TechnologyandWashington University in St. Louis, and the 2-1-1-1 Dual Degree in Engineering with theThayer School of Engineering at Dartmouth.

Religious Studies Major
Religious Studies Major
Study the religious dimension of cultures historically and globally.
As a Religious Studies major or minor, take an academic journey of acquiring awareness and understanding of religious dimensions, traditions and their significance across cultures and historical periods.
You’ll examine religion through various vantage points by taking both a broad range of interdisciplinary courses and making focused, critical inquiries into particular historic religious traditions, geographical areas, philosophical and critical approaches, and thematic and comparative studies.
Courses at any of the 5Cs are open to you and advanced students may, with permission, enroll in master’s level courses in their area of specialization at Claremont Graduate University.

Learning at Pomona
Community Water Policies in Morocco
During a semester abroad in Morocco, Haley Kirtland ’24 conducted ethnographic research on how water rituals in rural Morocco were deeply intertwined with agricultural irrigation practices.
Religion plays such an important role in individuals’ lives and society as a whole, and this fuels my understanding of the importance of studying religion. Whether individuals take one religious studies course or dedicate their lives to the field, it remains an important part of their lives and academic journeys.
Faculty & Teaching
Among our Religious Studies faculty members are professors awarded for their excellence in teaching. We have experts on a range of topics, including gender and sexuality studies and the Bible, corporate polytheism, modern Jewish philosophy, women and Islam, and Chinese Buddhist art.
Religious Studies enlarges students’ perspectives through examination of religious and secular world views, rituals, ethics and philosophies. It is an interdisciplinary field that looks as much at culture, politics and materiality as it does at religious doctrine. Our courses trouble inherited notions of self and other, even as they ask students to engage diverse traditions, practices, histories and power relations.

Undergraduate Research in Religious Studies
At Pomona College, students from all disciplines are encouraged to undertake research. Some apply for funded focused summer research through theSummer Undergraduate Research Program. Below are recent projects completed by students in the Religious Studies Department.
2019
Negotiating Religious Identity and Violence: Nazism, Zionism, and the Struggle for Palestinian Rights
Rachel Marandett ’20; Advisor: Zayn Kassam
Despite the traditional US educational model that seeks to explain genocide solely through the events of the Holocaust, the field of Genocide Studies, which emerged in the direct aftermath of WWII, can in fact be reframed to form a nuanced deconstruction of Holocaust discourse that helps to establish a new understanding of the Israeli-Palestinian conflict. I used my SURP grant, provided through my partnership with the Pomona College Humanities Studio, to jumpstart my senior thesis research by constructing a method to apply the extensive Holocaust discourse accessible today to the multiplicity of perspective on the Israeli-Palestinian conflict. I did this by conducting extensive archival research in Washington DC with the United States Holocaust Memorial Museum and other organizations, gathering interview and other hands-on data from sources in Palestine, Israel, and Germany, synthesizing research sources I acquired in my time studying in both the Czech Republic and Morocco, and working with the NGO Genocide Watch to explore their model of historical and contemporary genocidal processes. This work has led me to conclude that unlike any other historical event, the Holocaust can uniquely be used not only to provide invaluable insight into the Israeli and Jewish diaspora identity and perspective on the conflict, but also to establish a framework for understanding genocide that sheds light on the Palestinian narrative and crimes being perpetrated against them.
2017
The Question of Utopia for (Post-)Marxists
Saul Nadis ’19; Advisor: Oona Eisenstadt
The academic left today divides roughly into two camps: those who endorse identity politics and those who endorse class politics. Adherents of identity politics support a multitude of struggles—race, class, gender, sexuality, bodily morphology, etc. These struggles are usually deemed equal, but also intertwined, based on an awareness that what gets considered an identity itself is the result of struggle. Adherents of class politics, however, insist that all identity struggles are dependent on or have their origin in economic relations. However, this does not imply that identity struggles cannot gain some autonomy from such economic relations.  Perhaps one of the strongest advocates of class politics today is philosopher Slavoj Zizek, who labels class struggle an example of an “oppositional determination.” Zizek asserts that although “class” is just another identity within contemporary hegemonic struggles, the very possibility of the proliferation of a multitude of identities is itself overdetermined by “post-industrial” capitalism. I explore this claim’s value in juxtaposition with innovative concepts in contemporary identity politics — such as Lee Edelman’s “simthomosexual” anti-futurism and Jared Sexton’s qualified “afro-pessimism” — that provide an alternative ethics to the class-based optimism latent in neo-Marxism. Thereby, this paper connects differences in philosophical ontologies with some of the political differences that are hindering the left today.Funding Provided By: Paul K. Richter and Evalyn E.

Raised in the Pews: The Second-Generation Chinese American Christian Experience in the South
Nathan Hahn ’19; Advisor: Darryl Smith
“Raised in the Pews: The Second-Generation Chinese American Christian Experience in the South” was a study on Chinese American Christians who have grown up in the Southern United States. The goal was to find how cultural differences with older generations and their peers influence the religious experience and perspectives of Chinese Americans from the South with both older generations and their peers. The study was done using quota sampling of Chinese Americans from two Chinese churches in the South who had grown up there. Participants were each interviewed to give insight on how they feel their ethnic background influences the role that Christianity plays in their life and their identity. The study showed that second-generation Chinese American Christians who are brought up in the South see common ethnic background contributing to how they can build communities in church. Many described the desire to share a common ethnic background with those who they go to church with and the impact that it has. Individuals also expressed that a common faith acted as a bridge with peers of different ethnicities, often even emphasizing shared faith above ethnic difference.  Some also expressed the influence of differences between themselves and older generations within church. The study begins to provide a perspective on the religious experience of second-generation Chinese American Christians raised in the South and the impacts of cultural and generational difference.Funding Provided By: Aubrey H & Eileen J Seed Student Research Fund

Why I Majored
Why I Majored in Religious Studies
Haley Kirtland ’24
When I initially came to Pomona, I barely knew what religious studies was. I took a wide range of courses my first year, embracing what it means to be “undeclared.” The more time I spent exploring various fields though, the more my interests broadened. During the fall of my second year, I took my first two religious studies courses: Eye of God: Race and Empire and Religion and American Politics. In my Religion and American Politics course, I studied the relevance of religion in U.S. history and policy, focusing my term research on reproductive rights. Eye of God had a multi-media approach that challenged me to analyze and question texts unlike I ever had before. I was surprised by how different these courses were, and I quickly became hooked on the intellectual opportunities in the religious studies field. While my concentration is in religion and politics, I have taken courses ranging from Children’s Literature to God on Trial: Free Will and Evil.
The religious studies major is by nature interdisciplinary. I have been able to explore the intricacies of how communities are formed and interact with each other through anthropological, philosophical, and historical lenses. The range in my coursework has given me a diverse skillset that will serve me well long after I graduate. I appreciate the ways that nuance is embraced in my courses, and I have found that professors in the department are excellent at facilitating dialogue and teaching complex theories and ideas.
One of my favorite things about the religious studies major is how I have been able to combine my environmental interests with religious studies topics and theories. As a double major with environmental analysis, I have always been curious about human relationalities to the environment. My religious studies major has given me tools to conduct research and ask belief-based questions, solidifying my interest in the intersection of the two. During my semester abroad in Morocco, I focused my independent study on community water politics. In this ethnographic research, I explored how water rituals in rural Morocco were deeply intertwined with agricultural irrigation practices. This year, I have had the opportunity to do thesis research on similar topics in religion and the environment with the support of my professors and the department.
I have been surprised to find that my religious studies major appears in how I approach ideas and conflicts in my personal, professional, and academic experiences. Religion plays a significant role in all our lives–directly or indirectly–and I believe the religious studies major has equipped me well to think critically and creatively of the worlds we live in.
Alyssa Pedicino ’25
I have always had a passion for studying the history of different cultures, and in 7th grade history class, I remember learning about Islam for the first time. From that point on, I fell in love with the study of religion. I came to Pomona College planning to major in religious studies and have only been more certain of my decision the more courses I have taken in the field. There are so many great aspects of the major, one of which is the broadness of study. My fellow religious studies majors have so many diverse research areas that you would hardly believe they are in the same major. My area of concentration is Christian studies, and my research area is Medieval Christianity, with a focus in female saints' lives. This ties in nicely with my minor–late antique medieval studies.
The Religious Studies Department allows me to explore that intersection of religious studies, history, and gender and women's studies, and encourages that interdisciplinary approach. I even participated in a 2023 Summer Undergraduate Research Project at Pomona on hymnology related to Saint Brigit of Kildare, a female late antique medieval Irish saint. Within the flexibility of the department, my major advisor, Professor Kenneth Wolf, is in the adjacent department of Classics. Since his courses and research areas are religion-focused and align well with my interests, I am able to work well with him on my academic journey. Another aspect of the major's interdisciplinary nature is that courses outside of the department that are related to it can count toward your major. In my case, I took "Music in Christian Practice" with Professor YouYoung Kang at Scripps College, and this was one of my favorite courses I have taken in college. In looking at the intersection between music and Christianity, I was able to count the course toward my major and learned about topics that inspired my summer research project.
The major is also personal to me because of my own faith experience. I am Catholic and grew up involved in my church. But I am also very progressive, and finding the relationship between those aspects of my identity is a lifelong journey. My religious studies courses have allowed me to see other religions’ interactions with politics and how different types of Christianity handle politics. The major has even allowed me to have personal discernment of what I believe and expand my understanding of my own faith. The conversations I have inside and outside the classroom about religion not only fulfill me personally but allow me to express my passion to so many individuals. Religion plays such an important role in individuals’ lives and society as a whole, and this fuels my understanding of the importance of studying religion. Whether individuals take one religious studies course or dedicate their lives to the field, it remains an important part of their lives and academic journeys.
One of the best parts of the liberal arts experience is studying a field you are passionate about and turning that passion into action. My passion is religious studies, and I am so grateful I am able to study it at Pomona College.

Study the religious dimension of cultures historically and globally.
Statement of Solidarity
The Department of Religious Studies stands firmly with the call issued by the Intercollegiate Department of Africana Studies in pledging “to root out the scourge of anti-Blackness wherever it is discovered and however it manifests in the culture and operations of the Colleges.”
Studying religious traditions and their dimensions—broadly and specifically, critically and sensitively—is central to understanding cultural histories, politics, power dynamics and lived experiences.
Pursuing religious studies is an interdisciplinary journey of both academic knowledge and deeper understanding. Our students examine religion from a range of approaches, including geographical, philosophical, critical, thematic and comparative.
As a religious studies student, you will focus and gain strong familiarity with at least one religious tradition and be exposed to at least one tradition outside your concentration.
You will become a fluent analyst of the interaction of religion with cultural institutions, groups and individuals and you will appreciate the perspectives art and literature bear on religion.
We recognize the importance and legitimacy of personal involvement in the study of religion, but do not represent or advocate any particular religion as normative.
Our professors are not only experts they are dedicated teachers who will mentor you as you critically clarify your own assumptions.
Religious Studies offers a cooperative major/minor jointly with Claremont McKenna, Harvey Mudd, Pitzer and Scripps colleges. Courses at any of the 5Cs are open to you and advanced students may, with permission, enroll in master’s level courses in their area of specialization at Claremont Graduate University.
The multidisciplinary nature of the major prepares you not only for graduate studies in religion, but also schools of law, medicine and business. Our students have gone on to a variety of careers, including in management, journalism and the media, college administration, primary and secondary education, government and health and social services.

This timely book analyzes the resurgent influence of the Bible since 9.11, tracking the surprisingly frequent and contradictory political allusions to  Babylon in U.S. politics and culture. References to Babylon reveal much about the way biblical logics (often secularized) mediate a conflicted sense of political and financial control in times of uncertain global markets. Shaped by philosophy, culture, political discourse, and the history of biblical reception, the apocalyptic figure of Babylon becomes the writing on the wall for national fears and ambitions. Babylon reflects, depicts, and shapes national imaginaries around the war in Iraq, torture, family values, sexuality, democracy, citizenship, tyranny, freedom, the market, and the shape of national sovereignty.
The Babylon Complexsharpens our political analysis and makes us think twice about the place of religion in our national motivations.

Implementing Generative AI API Features for Ads Creative
By Joana Rocha
With Meta’sfirst generative AI-powered featuresfor ad creatives now available for all eligible1advertisers, you can now access these features via the Marketing API. These features aim to unlock faster ad creation and more creative variations, which will ultimately save advertisers time & resources, and improve the performance of ads.
What are these features?
Image Expansion: Seamlessly adjusts creative assets to fit different aspect ratios across multiple surfaces, like Feed or Reels, allowing advertisers to spend less time and resources on repurposing creative assets
Text Generation: Generates multiple versions of ad texts based on advertiser’s original primary copy, highlighting the selling points of their products/services and giving them multiple text options to better reach their audience.
Background Generation (for Advantage+ Catalog ads): Creates multiple backgrounds to complement the advertiser’s product images, allowing advertisers to tailor their creative assets for different audiences.
How does using the GenAI APIs benefit developers?
We are bringing 3 generative AI features to the Marketing API, so that Meta business partners, Agencies and Advertisers can take advantage of our GenAI offerings through your own platforms via Marketing API. These generative AI Creative features aim to help advertisers diversify and optimize creatives through automation thereby driving higher performance.
How can you get started implementing Meta’s generative AI API features via the Marketing API for your ads creative?
Check our ourimplementation guidethat offers a step by step process on how to implement these APIs

Generative AI features for ads coming to all advertisers
Today, we’re announcing that we’ve begun rolling out our first generative AI-powered features for ad creatives in Meta’s Ads Manager, with global rollout complete by next year. These unlock a new era of creativity that maximizes the productivity, personalization and performance for all advertisers. The new features –Background Generation,Image Expansion, andText Variations– will add to the AI-powered experiences and tools we continue tobuild for businesses.
Background Generation:Creates multiple backgrounds to complement the advertiser’s product images, allowing advertisers to tailor their creative assets for different audiences.
Image Expansion:Seamlessly adjusts creative assets to fit different aspect ratios across multiple surfaces, like Feed or Reels, allowing advertisers to spend less time and resources on repurposing creative assets.
Text Variations: Generates multiple versions of ad texts based on advertiser’s original copy, highlighting the selling points of their products/services and giving them multiple text options to better reach their audience.

What we learned from advertisers
Earlier this year, we announced theAI Sandboxwhere we’ve been testing these generative AI features with a small and diverse set of advertisers. These advertisers have been providing us with valuable feedback, including helping us ensure these products arebuilt responsibly. Here's what they've said about Meta’s generative AI for ads:
Generative AI can save time and resources while spurring productivity– According to a survey of advertisers that participated in early testing, most advertisers expect saving time and half of them estimate that generative AI will save themfive or more hours a week- the equivalent of one month per year - noting they’ll be able to create multiple asset variations with the click of a button, reducing time spent between creative and media teams on time-consuming editing tasks and allowing for more strategic work.1Nearly all advertisers also agreed that the products being tested in AI Sandbox will eventually help marketers drive campaign performance by enabling quicker development of more ad creative variations at scale.
“As an early adopter of Meta’s AI Sandbox, Publicis is excited to experience how it will apply to important client use cases, “said Keith Soljacich, EVP, Head of Innovation, Publicis Media Content Innovation. “Ad creative development that is faster, smarter and integrated into the larger Meta ad platform will be a game changer.”
Generative AI eases creative fatigue, but there is still room to customize– Creatives have a large impact on the performance of an ad,2and yet advertisers find it challenging to identify the best-performing creative at scale. Generative AI enables advertisers to introduce new ad creative faster, yet there is still work to do on delivering outputscustomized to every brands’ unique voice and visual style. We’ll need to define new ways of partnering with brands and agencies to help train these models on brands’ unique perspective.
What's next
Meta’s generative AI investments are focused on helping marketers to do their best work, by allowing them to launch & test ad creatives faster and easily reach the audiences they care about.
Today’s generative-AI powered ad features are just a start. We plan to offer advertisers more ways to generate ad copy to highlight product selling points or generate background images in minutes with tailored themes, like outdoor images for an athleisure brand. And as we shared atConnect, businesses will soon be able to use AIs for business messaging on Messenger and WhatsApp to engage with customers – helping with commerce, engagement and support, unlocking instant conversational responses. We’re testing with a small number of businesses in Alpha and plan to scale it further next year.
With millions of businesses advertising on our platform, we will continue to take a collaborative approach in developing these features and experiences so that they provide value to businesses and people.
